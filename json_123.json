The letter didn't cite a cause of death.</p>\n<p>But DeMarinis' sister, Jennifer Heissenbuttel, said DeMarinis died Sunday of the coronavirus.

Five school clusters have resulted in 39 cases and no deaths, according to the latest numbers available.</p>\n<p>Health officials said Tuesday that it was too soon to tell if a large motorcycle rally held at Perry Lake will cause a spike in COVID-19 cases.</p>\n<p>The five-day event, which ended Monday, was criticized last week by the state's top health official, Dr. Lee Norman, who cited it as an example of how Kansans might be relaxing their coronavirus-related safety practices too soon.</p>\n<p>The rally's organizer, Abate of Kansas Inc., did not know Tuesday how many people attended the event, which had been projected to draw at least 5,000 people. The group's vice president, Byron Harden, said masks were not required but were available for purchase, and Jefferson County provided 5,000 masks. Hand sanitizers and hand-washing stations also were provided.</p>\n<p>Byron said attendees used about 16% of the masks local government officials provided, but some had brought their own masks.</p>\n<p>Also on Tuesday, Kelly announced the state will receive $63 million in Federal Emergency Management Agency funds to help people who lost their jobs because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>\n<p>The money will be available only to those receiving at least $100 in unemployment benefits, and the payments won't be distributed any sooner than late September, the governor's office said in a news release. People who claim the benefit will have to certify that they are unemployed or partially employed specifically because of problems caused by the coronavirus.</p>\n<p>The payments will be retroactive to Aug. 1 and will remain in effect until FEMA ends the Lost Wages Assistance program.</p>\n<p>And on Monday, Kelly said she planned to seek renewal of a state COVID-19 emergency declaration, which is set to expire next week. Under a compromise with the Republican-led Legislature reached in June, the State Finance Council must approve such extensions, The Topeka Capital-Journal reported.</p>\n<p>Kelly noted the state continues to see an increase in COVID-19 cases, with 1,694 more confirmed cases reported Monday, along with four deaths.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We still have an emergency here,&rdquo; Kelly said. &ldquo;Just because Sept. 15 comes does not mean that the emergency is going to go away.

As of Tuesday, the state had reported 95,113 confirmed cases and 1,661 deaths.</p>\n<p>The state education department website shows that the most common option provides for onsite learning but also allows students to opt out and attend classes virtually. Data shows that 40.3% of the state&rsquo;s 878,627 public school students are in districts operating under that plan. DESE spokeswoman Mallory McGowin said it isn't yet known how many of those students are opting for virtual learning.</p>\n<p>Another 22.5% of students attend schools that blend onsite and virtual learning, and 11.2% attend classes in person with no virtual option.</p>\n<p>The remaining 26% of students are in schools with virtual-only classes.

The group's vice president, Byron Harden, said masks were not required but were available for purchase, and Jefferson County provided 5,000 masks.

Under a compromise with the Republican-led Legislature reached in June, the State Finance Council must approve such extensions, The Topeka Capital-Journal reported.\nKelly noted the state continues to see an increase in COVID-19 cases, with 1,694 more confirmed cases reported Monday, along with four deaths.\n\u201cWe still have an emergency here,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cJust because Sept. 15 comes does not mean that the emergency is going to go away.

As of Tuesday, the state had reported 95,113 confirmed cases and 1,661 deaths.\nThe state education department website shows that the most common option provides for onsite learning but also allows students to opt out and attend classes virtually.
