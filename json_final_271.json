School District to the list of those shutting down in-person classes after an outbreak of the coronavirus among students and staff.\nThe district announced Friday that the high school will move to online-only learning for two weeks starting Monday. The district said that as of 11 a.m. Friday, three staff members and four students at the high school have tested positive for COVID-19.\nAn additional 14 students and eight staff are in quarantine, the district said in a news release, \"which has made it difficult to operate the high school in a face-to-face setting in the short-term.\"\nThe district's five elementary schools and two middle schools will continue with a combination of face-to-face and online instruction.\nAlso this week, the Janesville, Iowa-Grant and Lake Mills school districts announced halts to in-person classes and extracurricular activities at some schools.\nJanesville's Craig High School and Roosevelt Elementary School were closed at the end of the school day Monday and will remain shuttered through at least Sept. 25. A district spokesman declined to say how many students at each school had tested positive for the virus, but said as of Monday morning six district students at the high school level and three students at the elementary level were positive.", "authors": [{"name": "Chris Rickert | Wisconsin State Journal", "link": "madison.com/users/profile/Chris%20Rickert"}]}]}
