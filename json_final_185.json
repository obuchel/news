It just takes a long time to get 300 million doses of vaccine made, and if we're looking at November as a potential date for a new vaccine, then people start thinking about, &quot;Well, what are we going to do when there's not enough?&quot; And that's where this proposal and <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Health/world-health-organization-announces-distribution-plan-COVID-19/story?id=73031332\">others</a> might fit in.</p>\n<p><b>How does the National Academies' report approach this problem?</b></p>\n<p>There are four phases to their distribution suggestions.

This goes well beyond the pandemic by using things like <a href=\"https://time.com/5795013/coronavirus-vaccine-prize-challenge/\">prize funds</a>.
