Why is this?</h2>\n<p>Much of our understanding of how viruses affect different populations comes from controlled experiments on isolated cells or animals &ndash; it is really difficult to make causal conclusions from the observations of the virus &ldquo;in the wild&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>I think that our data showing that there are differences in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in older adults and males is compelling, but the direct causal relationship between immune system differences and poorer outcomes in these groups will need to be confirmed in controlled laboratory experiments. These experiments just take some time.</p>\n<h2>In your research, you investigated the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. Can you describe how you carried out this research?</h2>\n<p>We used a technique called &ldquo;RNA sequencing&rdquo;, or RNAseq. When a diagnostic nasopharyngeal (NP) swab is taken, it collects both viral RNA and human RNA. In humans, RNA is transcribed from DNA genes and provides the instructions to a cell to make proteins, including the proteins used by the immune system to respond to and alert neighboring cells to a viral infection.</p>\n<p>We isolated RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs and compared the relative levels of each RNA between SARS-CoV-2 infected and uninfected individuals. We found RNAs encoding many genes to be increased or decreased in virus-infected individuals relative to controls. In this way, we were able to get a global picture of how the immune system responds to the virus.</p>\n<h2>What did you discover?</h2>\n<p>We found that classical antiviral pathways were activated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, in people aged 60 and over, the genes that help to recruit immune effector cells &ndash; the immune cells that can actually eliminate infected cells &ndash; were much less activated than in their younger counterparts. This suggests that older individuals may not be as able to clear the viral infection.</p>\n<p>Additionally, males had increased levels of genes that tell the immune system to dial back the antiviral response. We cannot say with certainty that these observations are responsible for the increased morbidity and mortality in elderly and male SARS-CoV-2 patients, but they could certainly be important contributing factors.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Elderly Men\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 673px, (min-width: 1090px) 667px, (min-width: 992px) calc(66.6vw - 60px), (min-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 40px), calc(100vw - 30px)\" src=\"https://www.news-medical.net/image.axd?picture=2020%2f9%2fshutterstock_129923204.jpg&ts=20200915051230&ri=1000\" srcset=\"/image.axd?picture=2020%2f9%2fshutterstock_129923204.jpg&ts=20200915051230&ri=1000 1000w, /image.axd?picture=2020%2f9%2fshutterstock_129923204.jpg&ts=20200915051230&ri=950 950w, /image.axd?picture=2020%2f9%2fshutterstock_129923204.jpg&ts=20200915051230&ri=750 750w, /image.axd?picture=2020%2f9%2fshutterstock_129923204.jpg&ts=20200915051230&ri=550 550w, /image.axd?picture=2020%2f9%2fshutterstock_129923204.jpg&ts=20200915051230&ri=450 450w\"></img><figcaption>Elderly Men</figcaption></figure>\n<p><em>Image Credit: Diego Cervo/Shutterstock.com</em></p>\n<h2>How does viral load affect the severity of the SARS-CoV-2 infection?</h2>\n<p>We found that <a href=\"https://www.news-medical.net/health/What-is-Viral-Load.aspx\">viral load</a> was correlated with the degree to which the antiviral response was turned on &ndash; patients with a larger amount of virus also had a larger amount of antiviral immune response genes.</p>\n<p>We did not have access to the data on the clinical outcomes of the patients included in our study, but other investigators have demonstrated that larger amounts of the virus are correlated with more severe infection.</p>\n<h2>How does your research help guide potential treatments for the SARS-CoV-2 infection?</h2>\n<p>I think our study shows that some of the clinical trials of different types of interferons &ndash; the body&rsquo;s most potent antiviral mediators &ndash; might be on the right track.
