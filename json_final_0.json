Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment on Wednesday reported a dozen active outbreaks linked to colleges and universities, with seven of them identified in the last week.</p>\n<p>This follows warnings by state public health administrators of a sharp rise in coronavirus infections among college-aged people, and new efforts this week at the University of Colorado Boulder and Regis University in Denver to slow the virus&rsquo; spread through student quarantines.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re asking students not to socialize at all,&rdquo; Trina Ruhland, of the Boulder County

infections in Colorado <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MegWingerter/status/1306326891914297345\">rose slightly over each of the last two weeks</a> after having declined since early August, an increase <a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2020/09/15/colorado-covid-cases-increase-boulder/\">driven in part by the surge in cases in Boulder County</a> that officials say is being driven by CU students gathering off-campus.</p>\n<p>Hospitalizations for COVID-19 had been falling since mid-July, but that decline has now slowed and appears to have plateaued, according to <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1osVuztn6Z27GJLtTsKrqThJb-lvGQLYP/view\">new modeling data released Wednesday</a> by the state health department and the Colorado School of Public Health. Deaths have slowed from earlier peaks, though the state reported Wednesday it <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattsebastian/status/1306362598573522944\">has surpassed 2,000 fatalities</a> among people who&rsquo;ve been sickened by the virus.</p>\n<p>Colorado&rsquo;s college and university outbreaks are connected to a combined 180 coronavirus cases, according to state data, but no deaths so far.

The campus has confirmed 441 coronavirus infections since classes started Aug. 24. Health officials have said nearly 70% of Boulder County&rsquo;s cases since then are associated with CU, which enrolls more than 30,000 students.</p>\n<p>Although CU&rsquo;s quarantine &mdash; which still allows students to go to class and work, get groceries, pick up food and exercise &mdash; is a recommendation, local police will step up enforcement and students can still face consequences for violating it, campus and government officials said during a news conference Wednesday morning.</p>\n<p>Later in the day, Boulder officials announced they&rsquo;d issued a mandatory two-week quarantine to a property at 1125 10th St., an annex of the Kappa Sigma fraternity, after they said residents repeatedly violated public health requirements. Residents who violate the order could face up to 90 days in jail and a $1,000 fine.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Residents of this property, unfortunately, have continued to gather socially and have not been responsive to voluntary compliance requests and existing health orders,&rdquo; City Manager Jane Brautigam said in a statement. &ldquo;Their behavior jeopardizes not only their lives, but also the lives and livelihoods of their neighbors and the rest of the Boulder community.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Boulder officials said they&rsquo;re also watching three other properties &mdash; two fraternity houses and one apartment building &mdash; for possible quarantine orders.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen more cases now than what I was expecting,&rdquo; CU Boulder Chancellor Phil DiStefano said during Wednesday&rsquo;s news conference. &ldquo;I was expecting it to be more later, but at least this gives us an opportunity to get back on the right track.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>State and local public health agencies are partnering with the university to open two new, free <a href=\"http://www.boco.org/COVID19Testing\">COVID-19 testing sites in Boulder. </a></p>\n<p>University officials said they expect case rates to climb as they ramp up testing efforts, but hope the recommended quarantine works to beat back surging cases.</p>\n<h3>Student disciplinary action</h3>\n<p>Gatherings of any type &mdash; even among small groups &mdash; could be a trigger for student disciplinary action, said Patrick O&rsquo;Rourke, CU Boulder&rsquo;s chief operating officer.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We know that this will pose challenges and we want our students to be able to access mental health services, to be able to attend classes and to be in a position where we are really trying to address what is the root cause of the spread, which is the social gatherings that have been taking place off-campus,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Rourke said.</p>\n<p>So far, 422 students have been referred for student code-of-conduct violations for not following public health orders, DiStefano said.
