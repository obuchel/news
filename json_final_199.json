The event, which began Wednesday, bills itself as the largest motorcycle rally in the Midwest. It includes five days of rides, vendor fairs, concerts and stops at area bars and restaurants, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.</p>\n<p>Missouri lifted pandemic restrictions on June 16, at a time when the state had a little over 16,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19.

Missouri has no statewide mask requirement nor capacity limitations, though several local governments have implemented their own restrictions.</p>\n<p>The White House Coronavirus Task Force has raised concerns about Missouri. The task force recommended that bars be closed and dining restricted in Missouri counties marked as &ldquo;yellow&rdquo; or &ldquo;red&rdquo; zones - meaning they have moderate to high levels of virus transmission.

Mike Parson were not immediately returned.</p>\n<p>Last month, similar concerns were raised before the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, which brought nearly 500,000 motorcyclists to South Dakota. The rally is seen as a big reason why infections have since surged in North Dakota and South Dakota, along with the return to schools and universities.</p>\n<p>Missouri ranks near the top of all states for new cases per capita.

The junior varsity game against Pleasant Hill next Monday has also been canceled.</p>\n<p>Noon -- Just two weeks after students started returning to Ball State University last month, the surrounding county had become Indiana&rsquo;s coronavirus epicenter.</p>\n<p>Out of nearly 600 students tested for the virus, more than half have been positive. Dozens of infections have been blamed on off-campus parties, prompting university officials to admonish students.</p>\n<p>University President Geoffrey Mearns wrote that the cases apparently were tied not to classrooms or dormitories but to &ldquo;poor personal choices some students are making, primarily off campus.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&quot;The actions of these students are putting our planned on-campus instruction and activities at risk,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Similar examples abound in other college towns across the nation. Among the 50 large U.S. counties with the highest percentages of student residents, 20 have consistently reported higher rates of new virus cases than their states have since Sept. 1, according to an Associated Press analysis.</p>\n<p>On average, infection rates in those 20 counties have been more than three times higher than their states&rsquo; overall rates.</p>\n<p>At James Madison University in Virginia, which recently sent students home through September amid a surge in cases, the county is averaging a weekly infection rate of nearly 90 cases per 100,000 people, or more than eight times the statewide average.</p>\n<p>Health officials fear that surges among college students will spread to more vulnerable people - older ones and those with underlying health problems - and trigger a new wave of cases and hospitalizations. Some worry that colleges could overwhelm hospitals already bracing for increasing cases of COVID-19 and flu this fall and winter.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s this waiting game. Does it stay on college campuses or will it escape?&rdquo; said Dr. Jeff Pothof, chief quality officer at the University of Wisconsin medical center in Madison, where cases among college students have been climbing.</p>\n<p>While universities have emerged as hot spots in nearly every state, many of the worst outbreaks have been scattered across the South and Midwest. Of the 50 college counties analyzed by the AP, James Madison&rsquo;s had the highest infection rate, followed by counties that are home to the University of Georgia, Florida State and Indiana University in Bloomington.</p>\n<p>In the 10 counties with the highest infection rates, colleges have reported at least 15,000 cases among students and employees in recent weeks, though testing and reporting practices vary significantly and the actual number is probably much higher.</p>\n<p>For many colleges, the return to campus was a carefully orchestrated process that took months to plan and millions of dollars to pull off. But as safe as they&rsquo;ve made their campuses, many colleges have struggled to curb off-campus gatherings that have been tied to thousands of infections.</p>\n<p>Parties were blamed for dozens of cases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which brought students back in early August only to send them home weeks later.</p>\n<p>Other schools have cracked down on parties and disciplined students. The University of Missouri in Columbia announced this week that it expelled two students and suspended three others for violating rules meant to slow the virus&rsquo;s spread.</p>\n<p>The outbreaks are increasingly straining relations between universities and their towns.</p>\n<p>Amid a spike in cases at the University of Colorado at Boulder, county health authorities Tuesday urged all students to quarantine for two weeks. Students and others at the university have accounted for 76% of the county's 663 positive cases over the past two weeks, officials said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;More stringent and mandatory restrictions will be imposed if students do not comply and break the transmission cycle,&rdquo; Jeffrey Zayach, executive director of Boulder County Public Health, warned in a letter to students.</p>\n<p>In a letter to students, the school's chancellor, Philip DiStefano, warned that the quarantine will be strictly enforced and that students who violate it could face suspension or other discipline. Already, DiStefano said, more than 400 students face university discipline for violating public health orders.</p>\n<p>At Miami University in Ohio, county health authorities ordered all of the school's athletes to isolate for 14 days last month after 27 tested positive for the virus. Last week, local police cited six men at an off-campus house party that included several students who had recently tested positive.</p>\n<p>As cases increase at Boston College and the campus runs out of quarantine space, the mayor of nearby Newton is asking the school not to use any of the town's hotels or other property to isolate students.</p>\n<p>Some cities have tightened rules at bars to discourage students from gathering.

The goal is to catch coronavirus in people who haven&rsquo;t even realized they&rsquo;re carrying it, KCUR reports.</p>\n<p>Some of the testing would be done at Wichita State University, where a new not-for-profit lab is gearing up to churn out hundreds of thousands of tests by the end of the year.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I know that sounds like a lot,&rdquo; said Tonya Witherspoon, Wichita State&rsquo;s vice president of industry engagement, &ldquo;but we think several labs in the state need to be able to do that much - or more.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Kansas has so far focused most of its energy on people who know either that they are ill or that they have had direct exposure to a confirmed outbreak. But experts say positivity rates should drop when a state or city goes beyond testing these groups of people who are most likely to be sick.</p>\n<p>Right now, about 15% of Kansans who get the test find out they have COVID-19. By Johns Hopkins University&rsquo;s calculations, that puts it among the states with the highest rates of new positives.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, Kansas health officials reported 971 new cases since Monday, for a total of 50,870 across the state. Kansas also had 52 new deaths, raising that number to 586 since the pandemic began.</p>\n<p>Norman said at a news conference that 37 of the new deaths were added through a review of death certificates. But that still meant 15 had occurred since Monday, a higher than normal number.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are getting to a very sensitive point in time as we talked about during Labor Day with universities, colleges and schools starting back again, athletics those sorts of things,&rdquo; Norman said. &ldquo;People are starting to mass gather again in ways that we didn&rsquo;t see as much of over the summer when people were more dispersed out. As the overall number count goes up, we are going to have more deaths.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The positive cases include 841 at the University of Kansas, where house parties near campus are raising alarms.</p>\n<p>After a debate during the Lawrence City Commission meeting Tuesday, a majority of the commissioners said they were interested in at least considering an ordinance that would make it a municipal offense to violate local health orders designed to stem the spread of the coronavirus, the Lawrence Journal-World reports.</p>\n<p>City Attorney Toni Wheeler said the offense would be a misdemeanor that could be prosecuted in municipal court. Violators could face a fine of no more than $500, up to 30 days in jail or both.</p>\n<p>However, Vice Mayor Brad Finkeldei and Mayor Jennifer Ananda said they were not sure that creating a municipal ordinance would be the best approach, and that perhaps stronger disciplinary action from the university, such as bans from campus, mandatory quarantines or suspensions, would be more effective.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Gov.

All told, 1,739 Missourians have died from COVID-19.</p>\n<p>Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services Director Randall Williams said about 60% of new cases are occurring in areas outside of the state&rsquo;s metropolitan areas. He said many of the places seeing spikes are mid-sized cities such as Joplin and Cape Girardeau.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We really need to concentrate on these middle-sized communities,&rdquo; Williams said.</p>\n<p>Parson also cited as reason for optimism what he called &ldquo;stable&rdquo; hospitalization totals.

The event, which began Wednesday, bills itself as the largest motorcycle rally in the Midwest. It includes five days of rides, vendor fairs, concerts and stops at area bars and restaurants, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.\nMissouri lifted pandemic restrictions on June 16, at a time when the state had a little over 16,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19. In the three months since then, the total has grown to 106,587. As of Wednesday, 1,739 Missourians have died. Missouri has no statewide mask requirement nor capacity limitations, though several local governments have implemented their own restrictions.\nThe White House Coronavirus Task Force has raised concerns about Missouri. The task force recommended that bars be closed and dining restricted in Missouri counties marked as \u201cyellow\u201d or \u201cred\u201d zones - meaning they have moderate to high levels of virus transmission. Camden and Miller counties, where Bikefest is taking place, are both in red zones, according the task force letter.\nMessages left Thursday with Bikefest organizers and a spokeswoman for Republican Gov. Mike Parson were not immediately returned.\nLast month, similar concerns were raised before the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, which brought nearly 500,000 motorcyclists to South Dakota. The rally is seen as a big reason why infections have since surged in North Dakota and South Dakota, along with the return to schools and universities.\nMissouri ranks near the top of all states for new cases per capita. Hospitalizations are rising, too. Three of the four highest days for hospitalizations have occurred since last week, according to data from the Missouri Hospital Association.\nCamden County reported 186 new coronavirus cases -- a 35% increase -- over the past two weeks, according to the University of Missouri\u2019s tracking site. Miller County reported a 49% increase with 123 new cases; and nearby Morgan County saw an 82% increase with 99 new cases.\nSteve Edwards, chief executive of Springfield-based CoxHealth, which operates several hospitals and health clinics in southern Missouri, said he is worried that Bikefest will increase cases both locally and wherever participants return home.\n\u201cThese events tend to draw many people into crowded spaces. It\u2019s especially worrisome if participants gather indoors at bars and restaurants which have proven to be high-risk areas,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cIt is reckless.\u201d\n7:45 a.m.-- Kansas\u2019 health department has suspended its reporting on individual businesses and other locations where clusters of coronavirus cases have occurred after only a week. The agency says it wants to make sure the data does not include cases that aren\u2019t current.

Laura Kelly\u2019s executive order requiring masks or other face coverings in indoor spaces in Johnson County, Kansas. The initial mask mandate in Johnson County was passed on July 2 after a lengthy public debate. There was another long debate on Thursday with the board hearing public comments from around 50 Johnson County residents before voting 4-3 to reaffirm the mask. READ MORE\n12:30 p.m. -- Clinton High School announced Thursday afternoon that its Friday night game against Pleasant Hill has been canceled due to COVID-19 concerns. The junior varsity game against Pleasant Hill next Monday has also been canceled.\nNoon -- Just two weeks after students started returning to Ball State University last month, the surrounding county had become Indiana\u2019s coronavirus epicenter.\nOut of nearly 600 students tested for the virus, more than half have been positive. Dozens of infections have been blamed on off-campus parties, prompting university officials to admonish students.\nUniversity President Geoffrey Mearns wrote that the cases apparently were tied not to classrooms or dormitories but to \u201cpoor personal choices some students are making, primarily off campus.\u201d\n\"The actions of these students are putting our planned on-campus instruction and activities at risk,\u201d he said.\nSimilar examples abound in other college towns across the nation. Among the 50 large U.S. counties with the highest percentages of student residents, 20 have consistently reported higher rates of new virus cases than their states have since Sept. 1, according to an Associated Press analysis.\nOn average, infection rates in those 20 counties have been more than three times higher than their states\u2019 overall rates.\nAt James Madison University in Virginia, which recently sent students home through September amid a surge in cases, the county is averaging a weekly infection rate of nearly 90 cases per 100,000 people, or more than eight times the statewide average.\nHealth officials fear that surges among college students will spread to more vulnerable people - older ones and those with underlying health problems - and trigger a new wave of cases and hospitalizations. Some worry that colleges could overwhelm hospitals already bracing for increasing cases of COVID-19 and flu this fall and winter.\n\u201cThere\u2019s this waiting game. Does it stay on college campuses or will it escape?\u201d said Dr. Jeff Pothof, chief quality officer at the University of Wisconsin medical center in Madison, where cases among college students have been climbing.\nWhile universities have emerged as hot spots in nearly every state, many of the worst outbreaks have been scattered across the South and Midwest. Of the 50 college counties analyzed by the AP, James Madison\u2019s had the highest infection rate, followed by counties that are home to the University of Georgia, Florida State and Indiana University in Bloomington.\nIn the 10 counties with the highest infection rates, colleges have reported at least 15,000 cases among students and employees in recent weeks, though testing and reporting practices vary significantly and the actual number is probably much higher.\nFor many colleges, the return to campus was a carefully orchestrated process that took months to plan and millions of dollars to pull off. But as safe as they\u2019ve made their campuses, many colleges have struggled to curb off-campus gatherings that have been tied to thousands of infections.\nParties were blamed for dozens of cases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which brought students back in early August only to send them home weeks later.\nOther schools have cracked down on parties and disciplined students. The University of Missouri in Columbia announced this week that it expelled two students and suspended three others for violating rules meant to slow the virus\u2019s spread.\nThe outbreaks are increasingly straining relations between universities and their towns.\nAmid a spike in cases at the University of Colorado at Boulder, county health authorities Tuesday urged all students to quarantine for two weeks. Students and others at the university have accounted for 76% of the county's 663 positive cases over the past two weeks, officials said.\n\u201cMore stringent and mandatory restrictions will be imposed if students do not comply and break the transmission cycle,\u201d Jeffrey Zayach, executive director of Boulder County Public Health, warned in a letter to students.\nIn a letter to students, the school's chancellor, Philip DiStefano, warned that the quarantine will be strictly enforced and that students who violate it could face suspension or other discipline. Already, DiStefano said, more than 400 students face university discipline for violating public health orders.\nAt Miami University in Ohio, county health authorities ordered all of the school's athletes to isolate for 14 days last month after 27 tested positive for the virus. Last week, local police cited six men at an off-campus house party that included several students who had recently tested positive.\nAs cases increase at Boston College and the campus runs out of quarantine space, the mayor of nearby Newton is asking the school not to use any of the town's hotels or other property to isolate students.\nSome cities have tightened rules at bars to discourage students from gathering. As cases surged at Illinois State, the town\u2019s mayor issued an order requiring all bar customers to be seated to be served. He also limited gatherings near campus to no more than 10 people.\nStill, residents and officials in many college towns are rooting for universities to work through outbreaks and avoid campus closings that could further hurt the local economy.\nFred Pryce, who manages a series of stores in a strip mall near Ball State, said sending students home would hurt the area\u2019s businesses \u201cbig time.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s 20,000-plus potential patrons that will vanish,\u201d Pryce said. \u201cThere are ways to keep students in Muncie safely while they do their classes.\u201d\n11:30 a.m. -- Two of Missouri's largest sports arenas will be used as polling places in November, election officials said.\nArrowhead Stadium, home of the Kansas City Chiefs, will be a polling place on Nov. 3. In Columbia, some voters will be able to cast their ballots at Mizzou Arena.\nAthletes across the county have led efforts to increase voter registration and promote the importance of voting as part of the response to social justice issues raised since the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis.\nChiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and safety Tyrann Mathieu have led voter registration drives and the Chiefs organization has posted videos on social media encouraging people to vote.\nMissouri athletes have held marches and rallies that included messages urging people to vote. On Wednesday, the basketball team released a video featuring players Mitchell Smith and Dru Smith saying they will push to have the entire team register to vote this year.\nBasketball coach Cuonzo Martin said on Twitter it was vital that everyone has a chance to vote.\n\u201cWe\u2019re thankful to be able to open the doors of our home and commit to making sure the Columbia community has that opportunity,\u201d he said.\n11:15 a.m. -- The Kansas City, Missouri, Health Department has reached out to 10 people urging them to self-quarantine after they may have been exposed to COVID-19 at the Chiefs\u2019 home opener last week. The department said an individual who attended the game and watched from a group\u2019s box in Arrowhead Stadium last Thursday tested positive for the coronavirus the very next day. READ MORE\n9 a.m. -- Kansas officials are considering spending $50 million to dramatically ramp up testing of people who aren't showing obvious signs of the coronavirus.\nA state task force this week backed Kansas Health Secretary Lee Norman\u2019s recommendation to use the federal stimulus money on testing at schools, workplaces and other sites. The goal is to catch coronavirus in people who haven\u2019t even realized they\u2019re carrying it, KCUR reports.\nSome of the testing would be done at Wichita State University, where a new not-for-profit lab is gearing up to churn out hundreds of thousands of tests by the end of the year.\n\u201cI know that sounds like a lot,\u201d said Tonya Witherspoon, Wichita State\u2019s vice president of industry engagement, \u201cbut we think several labs in the state need to be able to do that much - or more.\u201d\nKansas has so far focused most of its energy on people who know either that they are ill or that they have had direct exposure to a confirmed outbreak. But experts say positivity rates should drop when a state or city goes beyond testing these groups of people who are most likely to be sick.\nRight now, about 15% of Kansans who get the test find out they have COVID-19. By Johns Hopkins University\u2019s calculations, that puts it among the states with the highest rates of new positives.\nOn Wednesday, Kansas health officials reported 971 new cases since Monday, for a total of 50,870 across the state. Kansas also had 52 new deaths, raising that number to 586 since the pandemic began.\nNorman said at a news conference that 37 of the new deaths were added through a review of death certificates. But that still meant 15 had occurred since Monday, a higher than normal number.\n\u201cWe are getting to a very sensitive point in time as we talked about during Labor Day with universities, colleges and schools starting back again, athletics those sorts of things,\u201d Norman said. \u201cPeople are starting to mass gather again in ways that we didn\u2019t see as much of over the summer when people were more dispersed out. As the overall number count goes up, we are going to have more deaths.\u201d\nThe positive cases include 841 at the University of Kansas, where house parties near campus are raising alarms.\nAfter a debate during the Lawrence City Commission meeting Tuesday, a majority of the commissioners said they were interested in at least considering an ordinance that would make it a municipal offense to violate local health orders designed to stem the spread of the coronavirus, the Lawrence Journal-World reports.\nCity Attorney Toni Wheeler said the offense would be a misdemeanor that could be prosecuted in municipal court. Violators could face a fine of no more than $500, up to 30 days in jail or both.\nHowever, Vice Mayor Brad Finkeldei and Mayor Jennifer Ananda said they were not sure that creating a municipal ordinance would be the best approach, and that perhaps stronger disciplinary action from the university, such as bans from campus, mandatory quarantines or suspensions, would be more effective.\nMeanwhile, Gov. Laura Kelly hosted a discussion with rural hospital administrators on Wednesday where she urged them to \u201cexert pressure\u201d on lawmakers to support a proposal to expand Medicaid in Kansas.\nIn the discussion, Harold Courtois, CEO for the Memorial Health System in Abilene, said his organization is worried about running out of personal protective equipment, particularly medical N95 respirators, known as N95 masks, ahead of the flu season.\n\u201cMy fear is that during the influenza season, where everybody appears to have COVID -- whether it\u2019s influenza or not -- PPE is going to become scarce and be very difficult to acquire again,\u201d Courtois said. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t seem like we see a lot of PPE unless you\u2019re willing to pay enormous prices. There\u2019s still price gouging going on every week\u201d\n7:30 a.m. -- Johnson County reported Thursday morning 9,740 (+125) cases of COVID-19 since the outbreak started. The county said it has 7,017 presumed recoveries and 140 (+2) people have died since the start of the outbreak.\nIt also has tested 116,081 people with 107,171 negative tests for an overall positive test rate of 8.4%.

Mike Parson on Wednesday cited the state's declining death rate as evidence that progress is being made.\nParson, speaking at a news conference, noted that in the early days of the pandemic in April and May, more than 7% of all cases were fatal. That percentage has gradually dropped and so far this month, just 0.3% of Missourians infected with the COVID-19 virus have died.\n\u201cThis is all very encouraging and we continue to monitor this data each and every day,\u201d Parson, a Republican, said.\nStill, the number of confirmed cases has risen dramatically since the state reopened for business in mid-June. Missouri reported 1,191 new cases on Tuesday, bringing the total to 106,587 since counting began in March. Seven more deaths also were reported. All told, 1,739 Missourians have died from COVID-19.\nMissouri Department of Health and Senior Services Director Randall Williams said about 60% of new cases are occurring in areas outside of the state\u2019s metropolitan areas. He said many of the places seeing spikes are mid-sized cities such as Joplin and Cape Girardeau.\n\u201cWe really need to concentrate on these middle-sized communities,\u201d Williams said.\nParson also cited as reason for optimism what he called \u201cstable\u201d hospitalization totals. But the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that three of the four highest days for hospitalizations have occurred over the past week.\nData shows 1,021 patients in hospitals with confirmed or presumed COVID-19 on Saturday, the second-highest day on record. The highest was Sept. 9, when 1,040 patients were hospitalized. The fourth-highest number of hospitalizations on record occurred Friday, with 1,008 patients.\n4:30 p.m. -- New details are coming to light after the Kansas City, Missouri, Health Department shut down the Westport Ale House.
