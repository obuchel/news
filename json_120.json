The mayor said the school needs to take &ldquo;swift, decisive, and effective action right now.&quot;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They need to act now to protect the health of their Boston College community and all of our Newtonians,&quot; she said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Boston College community members are integrally connected with Newton &mdash; they live, shop, dine &amp; drink, play sports, work and recreate amongst our community,&rdquo; she said in an e-mail to Newton residents later Saturday evening. &ldquo;When COVID-19 spikes within the Boston College community, this impacts all of us in Newton.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The concern comes after a notable increase last week in the number of positive cases at the college, especially among athletes.</p>\n<p>So far 104 people have tested positive at the college, including 67 in the past week, according to testing numbers published Saturday by the university. Thirty of the college&rsquo;s 750 varsity athletes have tested positive, BC spokesman Jack Dunn said Saturday.</p>\n<p>Many of the student-athlete cases are linked to an off-campus gathering, where students watched a basketball game without wearing masks or socially distancing, Dunn said.</p>\n<p>Since the start of the semester, BC has suspended &ldquo;dozens of students,&rdquo; he said, for violating rules regarding social gatherings, and others have lost their on-campus housing for the year.</p>\n<p>Fuller said she and Deborah Youngblood, the Newton commissioner of health and human services, held a Zoom meeting Saturday afternoon with BC officials about the rising cases and urged the college to be more aggressive in finding and isolating cases.
