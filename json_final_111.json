A full 25 counties saw their COVID-19 case counts slip past one of the health department\u2019s thresholds, changing their recommendation toward more distance learning for more students.\nIn the most recent update, six counties are recommended to have all students do full-time distance learning: Blue Earth, Lyon, Stevens, Waseca, Winona and Yellow Medicine counties. All but Waseca County were previously recommended to allow at least some in-person learning.\nNot every county got worse. Eleven counties saw their case rates improve compared to last week\u2019s results, and saw their recommendation shift to more in-person learning.\nYou make MPR News possible. Individual donations are behind the clarity in coverage from our reporters across the state, stories that connect us, and conversations that provide perspectives. Help ensure MPR remains a resource that brings Minnesotans together.\nOverall, 24 largely rural counties have a recommendation of in-person for all students.\nThese recommendations are only considered the starting point for school districts, which make their own learning plans in cooperation with the Health Department.\nBecause Minnesota\u2019s calculation uses weeks-old data and calculates cases by the day a person got tested rather than the day the tests were reported, this update is not affected by recent reporting delays caused by the Labor Day weekend.\nBig jump in daily case counts, testing\nThe new school guidance map came out the same day officials unveiled their coming monthlong push to boost testing in selected regions around the state to curb community spread of the coronavirus.\nThe Health Department is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the jump in community spread across Minnesota \u2014 cases where people don\u2019t know how they contracted the disease, said Dan Huff, an assistant state health commissioner, as he explained the need to boost testing efforts.\nMinnesota is seeing cases leap in neighboring states, he added, and \u201cwe do not want that to happen here.\u201d\nOfficials are also pushing ahead on education and enforcement efforts to ensure restaurant owners and patrons comply with the state\u2019s masking and social distancing orders. Huff said that investigators want compliance in the \u201cmost unobtrusive way possible\u201d but that owners and customers had a responsibility to follow the rules.\n\u201cThis is a serious disease. We know that,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no vaccine. There\u2019s no cure, and it\u2019s contagious. Everyone needs to do their part.\u201d\nThursday\u2019s COVID-19 daily data report showed 931 new confirmed infections in Minnesota, one of the high single-day reports in the pandemic. But that came along with big testing numbers, suggesting this case spike may be largely due to more testing rather than greater community spread.\nTwo other closely watched metrics \u2014 the number of people currently hospitalized (242) and patients needing intensive care (132) inched downward from Wednesday, part of a downward trend in those cases since the start of September and far lower than their late-May peaks.\nOf the 86,722 confirmed cases of the disease in the pandemic as of Thursday, about 92 percent of those infected have recovered to the point they no longer need to be isolated.\nNine more deaths brought Minnesota\u2019s toll to 1,942. Among those who\u2019ve died, about 73 percent had been living in long-term care or assisted living facilities; nearly all had underlying health problems.\n\u2018This is not a cold\u2019\nAmong their worries this week, health officials have also expressed unease about the possible resumption of football and other fall sports in the pandemic.\nMinnesota has seen more than 1,400 cases of COVID-19 tied to sports activities in the pandemic, including nearly 900 in adults. Collectively, that caseload has led to recommended quarantines for more than 3,300 people.\n\u201cThis is not a cold,\u201d Dr. Ruth Lynfield, the state\u2019s epidemiologist, warned of COVID-19. \u201cThere are some people who do fine with this, but there are others, including young people, who do not do fine.\u201d\nShe noted studies showing heart and other health problems linked to COVID-19 that appear to linger beyond the infection.\n\u201cWe really don\u2019t have a sense of all the things this virus can do,\u201d she said.\nThe Big Ten intends to open its season Oct. 23-24. The Minnesota State High School League expects to meet on Monday to review its earlier decision to not play football and volleyball this fall in the face of COVID-19.\nWhile youth and college sports are important, COVID-19 poses a risk to student athletes as well as to the universe of coaches, friends and families that surround players, top state health officials said.\nThe Health Department was \u201cwatching with concern\u201d the rapid growth in new COVID-19 confirmed cases in the states surrounding Minnesota and bracing for potential higher daily case counts from over the Labor Day weekend, when people ventured out for informal get-togethers with family and friends, Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said earlier this week.\nThe state saw a jump in cases following the July Fourth holiday. Officials also worry about a one-two punch this fall and winter from COVID-19 and the typical flu season.\nOn Thursday, Malcolm and Kris Ehresmann, the state\u2019s infectious disease director, said it will take about two more weeks to determine if Labor Day gatherings led to a surge in cases.\nHealth Department investigators this week also going door-to-door in randomly selected neighborhoods in the Twin Cities and southeastern Minnesota as part of a statewide study to find out where COVID-19 is more prevalent.\nThey\u2019ll ask questions about where people spend time, whether anyone in the house has been diagnosed with COVID-19, and what information they'd like about the virus. They'll also offer free nasal swabs and serology tests.\nCollege campus worries rise\nPeople in their 20s make up the age bracket with the state\u2019s largest number of confirmed cases \u2014 topping 20,000 since the pandemic began, including more than 11,500 infections among people ages 20-24.\nThe numbers help explain why experts remain particularly concerned about young adults as spreaders of the virus.\nWhile less likely to feel the worst effects of the disease, experts worry youth and young adults will spread it to grandparents and other vulnerable populations and could also hamper attempts to reopen campuses completely to in-person teaching.\nThey\u2019ve been driving the recent outbreaks, although the number of high school-age children confirmed with the disease has also grown, approaching nearly 8,000 total cases for children 15 to 19 years old since the pandemic began.\nOn Sunday, just across the border from Minnesota, the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse responded to rising cases by moving all in-person classes online, closing dining halls and most campus buildings, and mandating face coverings at all times on campus, indoors or outdoors.\nWinona State University is in the middle of a 14-day campus quarantine that will limit all nonessential activities on campus to slow the spread of COVID-19. Winona State on Wednesday reported a current total of 125 active positive cases and 294 since late August.\nWinona State, Concordia College in Moorhead and Minnesota State University Mankato have each seen more than 100 cases tied to the schools and students in the last two weeks, Ehresmann said this week.\nRegionally, southern and central Minnesota and the Twin Cities suburbs have driven much of the increase in new cases while Hennepin and Ramsey counties show some of the slowest case growth in the state.\nHot spots have included southwestern Minnesota, where 75 cases have been traced to a late-August wedding in Lyon County that officials describe now as the state\u2019s largest single social spreader event.\nOn Monday, Minnesota officials also confirmed an outbreak of 122 cases at the federal women\u2019s prison in Waseca, which they said began when federal authorities transferred people into the facility from outside the state who had COVID-19.\nDevelopments around the state\nMayo Clinic introduces new coronavirus tracking tool\nMayo Clinic has launched a new COVID-19 case tracker. The online tool will breakdown coronavirus cases by county across 50 states and Washington, D.C.\nThe tool is aimed at helping people see emerging hot spots \u2014 information that can inform decisions about travel, and the safety of friends and family.\nThe tool includes total cases in each county and state, but also new cases, positive test rates, fatality rates and overall trends.\nThe data behind the new site is based on Mayo Clinic's own internal COVID-19 modeling tool, which it has used to predict how and where the virus will spread.\n\u2014 Catharine Richert | MPR News\nTwo GOP state lawmakers call on Walz to ease up on businesses\nTwo Republican state lawmakers are criticizing DFL Gov. Tim Walz over his administration\u2019s enforcement of COVID-19 restrictions.\nReps. Dave Baker, of Willmar, and Tony Jurgens, of Cottage Grove, say state inspectors are imposing stiff fines on restaurants and other hospitality businesses. They highlighted a Hastings restaurant Tuesday that is currently contesting $7,600 in fines, which were largely due to an employee removing a face mask while talking to customers.\nThe Busted Nut\u2019s owner, Tatia Nelson said it was an isolated incident, and she believes the fine is excessive.\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to do my best as a business, and I\u2019m trying to do everything right,\u201d she said.\nJurgens said the stepped-up enforcement appears to be a change in the administration\u2019s approach.\n\u201cWhen many of these executive orders were issued, the governor indicated that the purpose was to educate, not punish,\u201d Jurgens said. \u201cI believe I even remember somebody saying to hand out masks, not fines. But unfortunately, that\u2019s not the reality.\u201d\nBaker, a former restaurant owner, called on the governor to ease up on enforcement. He also urged Walz to allow more indoor seating in restaurants before colder weather hits.\n\u2014 Tim Pugmire | MPR News\nTop headlines\nStatewide testing push seeks to stem COVID-19 transmission: State health officials are launching a monthlong statewide testing effort aimed to stem transmission of the virus.
