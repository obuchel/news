That\u2019s the second most in the U.S. after New York. New Jersey has the nation\u2019s highest COVID-19 death rate per 100,000 residents.\nMore than 34,500 residents have recovered from the illness, according to Johns Hopkins University, though that number is likely much larger.\nNew Jersey has seen its daily numbers drop significantly since April, when officials were routinely announcing hundreds of new deaths and thousands of new cases a day.\nMurphy said in his TV interview that officials haven\u2019t seen major spikes from gyms and indoor dining reopening.\n\u201cNothing that we\u2019ve seen as of yet,\u201d the governor said on \u201cGood Day New York\u201d on Fox 5. \u201cOur numbers are up a little bit over the past few days. I think that\u2019s largely, not entirely, but largely due to the fact that we test per capita as much as any American state.\u201d\nState Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli said Friday the rise in cases lately is also because of gatherings \u2014 not just parties but \u201csolemn\u201d events like funerals.\n\u201cThis increase in cases reminds us this virus is unrelenting,\u201d Persichilli said. \u201cIt treats everyone the same. We are fighting an invisible enemy, and we must be cognizant of that fact.\"\nBecause younger residents are less likely to suffer severe cases, officials said the increase in cases among young adults and adolescents is a part of the reason deaths and hospitalizations are staying stable. But officials warn young residents could still pass the virus more vulnerable people.\nPlus, Persichilli said there were \u201cvery large\u201d case increases in Ocean and Monmouth counties recently, accounting for 736 new positives over the last week. Ocean had 112 positive tests on Thursday and 93 on Friday (the most in the state), while Monmouth had 83 on Thursday and 51 on Friday (the second most).\n\u201cWe cannot let our guard down,\u201d Persichilli said.\n\u201cThe fact we\u2019re still seeing deaths and hospitalizations is still a concern,\u201d added Dr. Christina Tan, the state epidemiologist.\nTRANSMISSION RATE\nNew Jersey\u2019s latest rate of transmission of 1.08 is up a tick from the 1.07 reported Thursday. It has been above 1 since Sept. 4 but stabilized earlier this week.\nAny number above 1 means each newly infected person, on average, is spreading the virus to at least one other person. Any number below 1 means the virus is decreasing.\n\u201cWith the big number of positives (lately), that number is bound to go up a little bit,\u201d Murphy said at his briefing. \u201cWe want to get that under 1.\u201d\nThe state\u2019s latest daily positivity rate \u2014 the percentage of residents who test positive in a single day \u2014 was 2.19% on Sept. 13, the date with the most recent available data. That means slightly less than 98% of residents tested that day were negative.\nHOSPITALIZATIONS\nThere were 413 patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases across New Jersey\u2019s 71 hospitals Thursday night. That\u2019s 18 fewer patients than the night before.\nOf those patients, 221 tested positive for the virus and 192 were under investigation while awaiting test results. Many of of the people under investigation for the virus turn out to be negative, officials have said.\nThursday\u2019s hospitalizations include 73 patients in critical or intensive care (12 fewer than the day before) with 36 on ventilators (four fewer than the day before).\nThere were 26 coronavirus patients discharged Thursday, according to the state\u2019s coronavirus tracking website.\nNew Jersey\u2019s COVID-19 hospitalizations have dropped dramatically since the state\u2019s peak in mid-April, when there were more than 8,000 patients.\nCOUNTY-BY-COUNTY NUMBERS\nAtlantic County: 3,944 positive tests (14 new), 244 confirmed deaths (11 probable)\nBergen County: 22,119 positive tests (34 new), 1,801 confirmed deaths (243 probable)\nBurlington County: 6,862 positive tests (35 new), 451 confirmed deaths (39 probable)\nCamden County: 9,633 positive tests (30 new), 550 confirmed deaths (53 probable)\nCape May County: 997 positive tests (8 new), 87 confirmed deaths (8 probable)\nCumberland County: 3,722 positive tests (12 new), 149 confirmed deaths (8 probable)\nEssex County: 20,773 positive tests (20 new), 1,896 confirmed deaths (229 probable)\nGloucester County: 4,258 positive tests (32 new), 217 confirmed deaths (7 probable)\nHudson County: 20,437 positive tests (19 new), 1,353 confirmed deaths (160 probable)\nHunterdon County: 1,277 positive tests (3 new), 71 confirmed deaths (54 probable)\nMercer County: 8,544 positive tests (11 new), 599 confirmed deaths (36 probable)\nMiddlesex County: 19,016 positive tests (48 new), 1,223 confirmed deaths (202 probable)\nMonmouth County: 11,403 positive tests (51 new), 772 confirmed deaths (92 probable)\nMorris County: 7,706 positive tests (16 new), 686 confirmed deaths (145 probable)\nOcean County: 12,095 positive tests (93 new), 977 confirmed deaths (65 probable)\nPassaic County: 18,774 positive tests (25 new), 1,107 confirmed deaths (143 probable)\nSalem County: 1,037 positive tests (4 new), 83 confirmed deaths (6 probable)\nSomerset County: 5,671 positive tests (42 new), 495 confirmed deaths (74 probable)\nSussex County: 1,431 positive tests (1 new), 161 confirmed deaths (37 probable)\nUnion County: 17,390 positive tests (19 new), 1,190 confirmed deaths (166 probable)\nWarren County: 1,428 positive tests (4 new), 158 confirmed deaths (13 probable)\nThere are another 314 positive cases that remain under investigation, with the patients' home counties not confirmed.\nAGE BREAKDOWN\nBroken down by age, those 30 to 49 years old make up the largest percentage of New Jersey residents that have caught the virus (31.1%), followed by those 50-64 (26.7%), 18-29 (15.8%), 65-79 (13.4%), 80 and older (9.3%), 5-17 (2.9%), and 0-4 (0.6%).\nOn average, the virus has been more deadly for older residents, especially those with pre-existing conditions. Nearly half the state\u2019s COVID-19 deaths have been of residents 80 and older (47.1%), followed by those 65-79 (32.3%), 50-64 (15.9%), 30-49 (4.3%), 18-25 (0.4%), 5-17 (0%), and 0-4 (0%).\nAt least 7,141 of the state\u2019s COVID-19 deaths have been of residents and staff members at nursing homes and other long-term care facilities.\nSeveral school districts in New Jersey have been forced to change plans for in-person classes because students or staff have tested positive for COVID-19. But Murphy said this week he does not foresee having to close all schools and implement universal remote learning like he did the last academic year.\nState officials are calling for residents to get flu shots to help avoid a possible \u201ctwin-demic\u201d in the fall.\nIn addition, New Jersey is still calling on travelers from 30 states and territories that qualify as hotspots to voluntarily self-quarantine for 14 days after arriving. That includes residents returning home from a trip.\nThe number of deaths in New Jersey related to COVID-19 could surpass the 16,200 annual deaths from cancer the state has averaged \u2014 which would make the virus the state\u2019s No. 2 killer, after heart disease, according to mortality data from the state Department of Health.\nNew Jersey has begun allowing some of the businesses listed in Stage 3 of its recovery plan to reopen with restrictions. Murphy has said he could tighten guidelines if there are sustained increases or if businesses and patrons don\u2019t comply with the rules.\nThe virus has taken a major toll on the state\u2019s economy. More than 1.56 million residents have filed for unemployment, businesses have lost untold revenue, and numerous businesses have closed permanently. In good news, weekly unemployment claims fell to a new low Thursday for the first time in five weeks.\nGLOBAL NUMBERS\nAs of early Friday afternoon, there have been 30.25 million positive COVID-19 tests across the globe, according to a running tally by Johns Hopkins University. More than 947,200 people have died, while more than 20.57 million people have recovered.\nThe United States has the most positive tests in the world, at more than 6.68 million, and the most deaths, at more than 197,900.\nOur journalism needs your support.
