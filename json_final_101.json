The large-scale camps are a tinderbox for potential outbreaks of infectious disease.

The situation is exacerbated by Somalia's weakened health care infrastructure, which has been fractured by natural disasters and 30 years of civil war.</p>\n<p>The humanitarian crisis is already acute. Somalia has some of the lowest health indicators in the world with life expectancies of 54 years for males and 57 years for females. Somalia ranks 194 out of 195 countries in preparedness for a globally catastrophic biological event such as a disease outbreak, according to the Global Health Security Index.

The investigators wanted to gage people's knowledge and perceptions about COVID-19 and whether individuals were experiencing symptoms of COVID-19. The study also sought to identify pre-existing health conditions within the IDP camp populations that might be exacerbated by COVID-19 and to what extent preventive measures and medical treatment are available. The survey was the first of its kind undertaken in the Somali camps and is believed to be only the second such study to document knowledge of COVID-19, symptoms and risk factors among displaced populations globally.</p>\n<p>While 77% of respondents took at least one precaution to avoid COVID-19 (such as frequent hand washing), all reported a lack of adequate sanitation in the camps, an inability to physically distance and a nearly universal inability to get tested for COVID-19 due to a lack of available resources. When asked about specific COVID-19 prevention and treatment options, about half the time respondents expressed no knowledge of them. The majority of respondents were not familiar with basic information about the virus, including the fact that SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic. A high number of respondents also reported at least one potential symptom of COVID-19 such as headache, cough, fever, etc. although no official diagnosis was undertaken or confirmed.
