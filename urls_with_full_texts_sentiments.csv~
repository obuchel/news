The number of COVID-19 outbreaks tied to Colorado colleges more than doubled this week, with four universities now identified as hot spots.
The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment on Wednesday reported a dozen active outbreaks linked to colleges and universities, with seven of them identified in the last week.
This follows warnings by state public health administrators of a sharp rise in coronavirus infections among college-aged people, and new efforts this week at the University of Colorado Boulder and Regis University in Denver to slow the virus’ spread through student quarantines.
“We’re asking students not to socialize at all,” Trina Ruhland, of the Boulder County Attorney’s Office, said during a news conference Wednesday to discuss public health officials’ recommendation that all CU Boulder students quarantine themselves.
Coronavirus infections in Colorado rose slightly over each of the last two weeks after having declined since early August, an increase driven in part by the surge in cases in Boulder County that officials say is being driven by CU students gathering off-campus.
Hospitalizations for COVID-19 had been falling since mid-July, but that decline has now slowed and appears to have plateaued, according to new modeling data released Wednesday by the state health department and the Colorado School of Public Health. Deaths have slowed from earlier peaks, though the state reported Wednesday it has surpassed 2,000 fatalities among people who’ve been sickened by the virus.
Colorado’s college and university outbreaks are connected to a combined 180 coronavirus cases, according to state data, but no deaths so far. An outbreak begins when two or more cases are linked to the same location or event, and ends when no new cases have been tied to that source for four weeks.
The largest of those outbreaks are at Denver’s Regis University, with 45 cases; Colorado College in Colorado Springs, with 32 cases; and CU Boulder’s Delta Gamma sorority, with 25 cases, according to state data. Those counts include both confirmed and probable cases.
In addition to Delta Gamma, CU Boulder has outbreaks tied to four other fraternity and sorority houses: Alpha Phi, Gamma Phi Beta, Phi Kappa Psi and Pi Beta Phi.
The University of Denver reported three outbreaks, involving a residence hall, a gymnastics team and the Ritchie Center for Sports and Wellness. An unspecified sports team at Colorado Mesa University also had an outbreak.
On Wednesday, Regis ordered 137 students living in on-campus housing to quarantine for two weeks after health officials traced nearly 60% of cases linked to the school to the Resident Village housing complex.
For this week only, Regis — which enrolls about 8,000 students — also pivoted most in-person classes to virtual learning as it ramps up testing.
“All these actions are being taken to quell further spread of the virus in the community,” Regis leaders said in a news release.
Surge in Boulder
In Boulder, CU leadership and local officials detailed what is expected of students and what consequences await those who choose not to follow public health guidance.
Boulder County on Tuesday recommended a two-week self-quarantine of all CU Boulder students as COVID-19 cases continue to rise. The campus has confirmed 441 coronavirus infections since classes started Aug. 24. Health officials have said nearly 70% of Boulder County’s cases since then are associated with CU, which enrolls more than 30,000 students.
Although CU’s quarantine — which still allows students to go to class and work, get groceries, pick up food and exercise — is a recommendation, local police will step up enforcement and students can still face consequences for violating it, campus and government officials said during a news conference Wednesday morning.
Later in the day, Boulder officials announced they’d issued a mandatory two-week quarantine to a property at 1125 10th St., an annex of the Kappa Sigma fraternity, after they said residents repeatedly violated public health requirements. Residents who violate the order could face up to 90 days in jail and a $1,000 fine.
“Residents of this property, unfortunately, have continued to gather socially and have not been responsive to voluntary compliance requests and existing health orders,” City Manager Jane Brautigam said in a statement. “Their behavior jeopardizes not only their lives, but also the lives and livelihoods of their neighbors and the rest of the Boulder community.”
Boulder officials said they’re also watching three other properties — two fraternity houses and one apartment building — for possible quarantine orders.
“We’ve seen more cases now than what I was expecting,” CU Boulder Chancellor Phil DiStefano said during Wednesday’s news conference. “I was expecting it to be more later, but at least this gives us an opportunity to get back on the right track.”
State and local public health agencies are partnering with the university to open two new, free COVID-19 testing sites in Boulder.
University officials said they expect case rates to climb as they ramp up testing efforts, but hope the recommended quarantine works to beat back surging cases.
Student disciplinary action
Gatherings of any type — even among small groups — could be a trigger for student disciplinary action, said Patrick O’Rourke, CU Boulder’s chief operating officer.
“We know that this will pose challenges and we want our students to be able to access mental health services, to be able to attend classes and to be in a position where we are really trying to address what is the root cause of the spread, which is the social gatherings that have been taking place off-campus,” O’Rourke said.
So far, 422 students have been referred for student code-of-conduct violations for not following public health orders, DiStefano said. These violations range from smaller dings like students not wearing masks in their dormitory halls to more concerning violations such as students hosting large parties, O’Rourke said.
O’Rourke said as of Wednesday morning he did not believe any CU Boulder students have been expelled for violating public health orders.
Still, university officials did not directly answer questions Wednesday about what, specifically, would prompt the university to make the switch from in-person to remote learning, as Colorado College recently did along with other campuses across the country.
“It’s not so much the number of cases that’s the greatest concern,” O’Rourke said. “It’s how quickly we’ve escalated in terms of those number of cases… that leads us to the point at the moment where we need to partner with the county to create a greater set of expectations.”
If the suggested quarantine doesn’t work, Ruhland, from the county attorney’s office, said, Boulder County would consider issuing a public health mandate that, if broken, could subject violators to criminal and civil penalties including fines or jail time.
“We know the vast majority of our students are doing the right thing to keep our community safe and we’re grateful for that,” DiStefano said. “Even so, we’ve had enough of our students choosing to gather in large groups and choosing to not wear masks.”
Other Colorado outbreaks
The new statewide list released Wednesday also included two K-12 schools with new outbreaks, bringing the total to six active situations. The state health department declared an outbreak at Battle Mountain High School, in Eagle County, over on Friday.
The newest outbreaks are in Westminster High School, with three student cases, and Parker Core Knowledge Charter School, an elementary and middle school in Douglas County, which reported five cases among students and one involving a staff member.
Sand Creek Elementary School added three cases this week, but the other existing school outbreaks remained stable.
The largest ongoing outbreaks in Colorado continue to be in correctional facilities, though the Buena Vista Correctional Complex dropped from the list when its 213-case outbreak was declared over on Tuesday.
The state’s 10 largest outbreaks are:
Sterling Correctional Facility: 618 cases, three deaths (three new cases since last week)
Van Cise-Simonet Detention Center, Denver: 582 cases, no deaths (no new cases)
JBS meatpacking plant, Greeley: 294 cases, six deaths (one new case)
People experiencing homelessness, Denver: 156 cases, no deaths (no new cases)
Steven Roberts Original Desserts, Aurora: 142 cases, one death (one new case)
Elms Haven Center, Thornton: 106 cases, 11 deaths (11 new cases and 1 new death)
Denver County Jail: 83 cases, no deaths (no new cases)
Weld County Jail, Greeley: 77 cases, one death (three new cases)
Jabil Healthcare, Monument: 68 cases, no deaths (no new cases)
Advantage Treatment Center, Sterling: 54 cases, no deaths (all cases reported in the last week)
This is Advantage Treatment Center’s second outbreak. From June to July, it recorded 31 cases, but no deaths.

More than 1,700 students at Cherry Creek High School are now attending classes remotely after an outbreak of positive COVID-19 cases was detected among the student body.
In a letter to families, the district said “several” 12th-grade students tested positive, forcing 14 staff members and 146 other students into quarantine until Sept. 23. Abbe Smith, spokesperson for Cherry Creek School District, said the school has seen six positive cases in the last two weeks.
An additional 1,585 students in the same cohort have been moved to remote learning for the duration of the quarantine period. Those students are still able to participate in sports and other activities, the district said — except for those determined to be close contacts, who must quarantine.
About 3,500 ninth- through 12th-graders attend Cherry Creek High School and because of the size of enrollment, students are divided into two cohorts this semester, said Smith. She did not detail how, if at all, this incident may affect in-person learning operations moving forward.
Cherry Creek School District said the cases “have been tied directly to students attending off-campus parties the last two weekends,” adding that the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment classified the cases as an outbreak.
The state puts that list out on Wednesday afternoons and has previously reported at least five other schools to be the site of outbreaks.
Earlier this month, Heritage High School in Littleton moved its entire student body to remote learning for two weeks after about one-third of teachers were forced to quarantine due to possible COVID-19 exposure."

That includes Grand Valley State University with 438 cases, Adrian College with 229 cases, Central Michigan University with 271 cases and Michigan State University with 202 cases, according to state data released at 3 p.m. Monday. Those schools are spread out across the state — GVSU is on the west side, CMU and MSU are mid-Michigan, and Adrian is in the southeast.
MSU is the only one of this group to not be holding in-person classes or hosting large numbers of students in residence halls, but has a considerable number of students living off-campus.
The state isn't surprised to see the numbers, Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, the state's chief medical executive and chief deputy for health, told the Free Press.
""I think it was what a lot of people expected,"" she said. ""All it takes is one person who is infected to spread it.
""It's about an entire lifestyle,"" she said, adding that included students going out and partying without masks. ""That's what we're seeing across the state. I know there are many college students who are doing the right thing. I would encourage everyone to"" wear a mask and maintain social distancing.
The data shows the state ""is still in the middle of the pandemic,"" Khaldun told the Free Press. ""It is concerning what we are seeing. It's a reminder that people have to be intentional about practicing"" good behaviors.
The numbers
Monday was the first time the state has published the names and locations of schools with outbreaks. It said it would update the data at 3 p.m. every Monday. The numbers in the state data may be different from what a school itself discloses elsewhere because of differing reporting requirements.
See the data with schools and numbers:Tracking coronavirus outbreaks in Michigan schools
The state data comes from 45 local health departments. A COVID-19 outbreak is defined as two or more cases with a link by place and time indicating a shared exposure outside of a household, the state said in a news release. The numbers tied to a school are those thought — through contact tracing — to have been exposed through a school.
Students or staff exposed to COVID-19 outside a school building who are not thought to have spread the virus in school due to quarantine or self-isolation are not included in the data.
The data has some limitations, Khaldun said. Just because a school isn't listed doesn't mean there aren't students or staff with positive tests. It just means that either contact tracing couldn't identify where they were exposed or that they were exposed and not linked to the school.
""This information does not provide a complete picture of school outbreaks in Michigan and the absence of identified outbreaks in a school does not mean it is not experiencing an outbreak,"" the state said in its release.
Outbreaks can be difficult to predict, said Dr. Rob Davidson, a western Michigan emergency room physician and executive director of the Committee to Protect Medicare.
“You always prepare for the worst and hope for the best,” Davidson said. “And if you prepare for the worst and it doesn't happen, everyone thinks you've overdone it.
“My concern isn't that the whole state will become one big hot spot. My concern is there will be communities that have significant outbreaks related to kids going back to school. We don't know where they'll be. We don't know how many and when they will exactly occur, but through this fall, we're going to see community transmission. And in places where I work in rural west Michigan the concern would be do we have enough cases that then overrun your hospital, which is always the thing we've been trying to avoid from the beginning.”
It's vital, he said, for public health officials to be transparent about cases and outbreaks, and the MDHHS report is a good first step. But, he said, it’s challenging to get accurate data when testing capability is limited by shortages of swabs and reagents.
“I think they're fully aware that it's almost certainly an underreporting simply because of their inability to adequately test,” he said. “I think if you juxtapose what's happening in Michigan compared to what's happening in Florida, we are light years beyond them. Their governor is actively asking schools not to report cases and some are defying that and actually quoting numbers. So I think that we want to get the numbers out there. I think that's a great place to be. It would just be nice if the capability of testing could keep up with the actual pandemic and then we'd have a better idea of what's really going on.”
Colleges see spread
On the first weekend after classes started, Mount Pleasant was awash in Central Michigan University students partying and gathering without masks. On that Saturday night in August, the Free Press observedstudents gathered outside of apartment buildings off campus, drinking, playing beer pong and hanging out, almost completely without masks.
On campus, a large pickup basketball game — in most times a healthy choice for students to make — had broken out. Most of the two dozen players were unmasked.
A rapid spike in cases followed that weekend, prompting the local health department to issue a local health emergency banning large gatherings.
But Central wasn't alone in seeing outbreaks.
At Adrian College, a small liberal arts college about 90 minutes southwest of Detroit, students told the Free Press of large gatherings and of students with positive cases being quarantined in dorms with students who hadn't tested positive.
At Grand Valley, administrators said the large numbers were coming from counting students who were living off-campus.
""It has been reported that Grand Valley has the highest number of COVID cases among Michigan’s public universities. This is because we count the known condition of all our students, while many other colleges count only the students living on campus,"" Greg Sanial, vice president for finance and administration and interim director of the Virus Action Team, told an internal GVSU publication. ""If we reported only our on-campus numbers, we would have one of the lowest numbers of reported cases.""
MSU's spike comes despite having online-only undergraduate classes. Students are still living in off campus housing and late last week, the health department urged anyone who had been to MSU's campus to quarantine for 14 days.
Dr. Peter Gulick, an infectious disease specialist and associate professor of medicine at Michigan State University’s College of Osteopathic Medicine, said that although seeing 1,422 new or ongoing outbreaks at the state’s K-12 schools and universities might seem alarming, transparency should be an essential first step in the public health response.
“We have to be transparent,” he said. “We have to make sure everybody hears about these things. I think the reporting is good, but then making sure that we act on what we report, that we find out where those cases are, and then we do something about it” is even more vital to contain the spread of the virus. “You have to try to find out where those cases are located, and isolate them and quarantine them.”
At MSU, Gulick said more than one-third of the cases are tied to sorority and fraternity gatherings.
“It’s students gathering together in groups, not practicing the recommended precautions because they're just not afraid of it are just not aware of it,” Gulick said. “The president of the university pretty much said now everybody's going to be under quarantine because this can be just the beginning of a large spike … if we're not careful and we don't control things. When you start getting spikes like that, you’ve got to look at the whole situation and try to find out what the reason was for this occurring and put a lid on it right away because it could accelerate into a major outbreak.”
And while schoolchildren and young adults aren’t as likely to be hospitalized, need ventilator care or die of COVID-19 as older people and those with preexisting health conditions, Gulick said there’s still a risk that students can spread the virus to more vulnerable populations.
“That is the fear of what's going to happen in the fall with the schools,” he said. “Those young individuals can spread it to high-risk people, like the elderly, like ones with co-morbid conditions. And then we start to fill up the hospitals again. We don't want to do that with the next spike. I do think the fall is going to bring another spike.
“Hopefully, it'll be a spike with a death rate that is low and hospitalization rates that are also low. Maybe the case counts will be up a little bit, but we need to contain that. We don't want to it to spread to as many high-risk people again because that's where you really run into issues.”
Testing both symptomatic and asymptomatic people, along with contact tracing, isolation and quarantining are the keys to controlling the spread of the virus, he said.
“Anywhere from 10% to 40% of COVID-19 infections occur in individuals that may not have symptoms of COVID-19,” Gulick said. “That's how we're going to discover more of these people is by testing more, recognizing these cases and isolating them in quarantine and then getting their contacts isolated as well.”
Fewer cases in K-12
There are fewer outbreaks listed in K-12 schools across the state, according to the new state data.
The largest K-12 outbreak listed in state data is at Luce Road Elementary School in Alma, where there are six cases, involving both students and staff.
A Sept. 5 letter to parents from the district acknowledged there were two cases found in a first-grade classroom at the school. A separate letter from the local health department states the cases were connected to staff members. Neither letter references six confirmed cases or that students were also affected.
In each letter, the district and health department announced the school would be temporarily closed. While students at the school transitioned to an online education model after the closure, the letter stated the district planned to return to in-person education at the school on Friday.
""We understand how hard it is for families to make alternate arrangements on short notice and we appreciate your help in stopping the spread of the disease through this quick action,"" Jennifer Morse, a local medical director, noted in her letter to parents.
Parents responding to the letter on Facebook offered mixed reactions, from thanking the district for being transparent to frustration over the district's handling of the information.
No other K-12 school had more than four confirmed cases, according to the state.
Most of the districts with outbreaks are offering a blended/hybrid model of in-person and online classes. It was not immediately clear whether the students or staff who have COVID-19 were at school, or all in the same classroom.
No Detroit Public Schools Community District schools were included on the list.
Khaldun said she knows schools are doing their best to make sure students are masked when in classrooms, are keeping social distance and doing additional cleaning.
However, she said that needs to happen not only at school, but also at home, where parents need to make sure students aren't being exposed to the virus.
Other ways to monitor
State Rep. Darrin Camilleri, D-Brownstown Township, the minority vice-chairman of the House Education Committee, said the numbers at colleges show administrators need to be doing everything they can in the areas of contact tracing and infection monitoring to ensure outbreaks are brought under control quickly.
One method Camilleri has heard about — and would like Michigan university administrators to explore — involves testing wastewater from on-campus student housing units to quickly detect whether a student who lives in the dorm might have COVID-19. Such testing has been used in Illinois and Utah, as well as other states.
Another possibility, Camilleri said, is opt-in cellphone technology that would alert students when they are potentially coming into contact with the virus.
“We need to be mindful of privacy,” he said. “I don’t think it’s appropriate to force that type of monitoring.”
Mayors of college towns should also make sure they are doing everything they can to monitor and if necessary, shut down, off-campus gatherings, he said.
At the K-12 level, Camilleri said he is pleased to see the return to class appears to be going relatively well, so far.
“As long as teachers have PPE and students have PPE, and everyone is complying, I think there are cases where it can be safe” to return to classrooms, he said.
But as a former teacher, Camilleri said he is concerned that initially strong compliance may get lax over time, resulting in more outbreaks.

3,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/western-university-students-outbreak-1.5728015,-2.673,How a handful of students caused Western University's COVID-19 outbreak,"A group of students living off-campus, who came together and engaged in high-risk behaviour, triggered a COVID-19 outbreak that has raised to 28 the number of positive tests among Western University students in London, Ont.
After months of case counts that put London among the lowest areas for coronavirus transmission in Ontario, the local health unit is now dealing with a serious outbreak. According to the Middlesex-London Health Unit (MLHU) the new cases originated with a group of 15 young people including 11 who lived in three different student houses.
They came together and mixed with others in bars and at parties over a five-day stretch starting Sept. 8. During these get-togethers, they took part in behaviour that showed little regard for rules in place to curb the spread of the deadly virus.
At a news update Thursday, Dr. Chris Mackie, London's medical officer of health, presented a chart that showed how detailed contact tracing linked these individuals and how they came together at various gatherings. The chart shows how the students went out to bars together, met to watch a basketball game and even shared drinks and an e-cigarette.
Of the 28 Western students now infected, all but one live off-campus. A statement from the university issued Thursday said all students and their close contacts are in isolation, including the student on campus, who lives in residence.
Western president Alan Shepard called the outbreak ""very concerning"" at a media update Thursday.
""We expect our students to comply with public health rules,"" he said. ""We're asking them not to host parties. Not to attend parties. Limiting social activities to your roommates and significant others will help stop the spread of the virus. Common sense is critical.""
'You are going to kill someone'
London Mayor Ed Holder was more scathing, saying he was ""angry and frustrated"" over the outbreak. He implored young people who are ""part of the problem"" to change their behaviour.
""If this continues, you are going to kill someone,"" he said. ""Should daily case counts remain this high for a sustained period, community spread is a near certainty, and it's a matter of 'when' not 'if' somebody dies. What an awful burden to carry.""
London announced 11 new cases of COVID-19 on Thursday; 10 are Western students and one a student at Fanshawe College. The university confirmed those numbers, combined with cases announced over the weekend, mean a total of 28 Western students have now tested positive.
London has had 776 coronavirus cases since January. Of those, 40 remain active, all others are ""resolved."" A total of 32 cases have been identified in the past five days.
The outbreak has prompted Western to halt many non-academic activities on campus, including suspending athletics and recreation activities and in-person student club meetings and events.
Shepard said the university wouldn't hesitate to enforce its code of conduct, which carries punishments that range from reprimand to full expulsion for behaviours that put others at risk. Shepard also, however, conceded that the code's authority is limited when it comes to student behaviour off-campus.
Risky behaviour
In presenting the contact tracing information, Mackie said the cases are linked to risky and unnecessary close contact.
""It's gathering in large groups, it's gathering with people from outside of your household or outside of your bubble,"" he said. ""It's unnecessary, very close contact. Things like sharing food, drinks and e-cigarettes, things we know are the highest risk of spreading COVID-19.""
A social media campaign aimed at reminding students about COVID-19 rules was launched before students began to arrive around Labour Day Weekend. While most students appear to be following the rules, people have called police after seeing house parties where students weren't distancing or wearing masks.
There have not been many incidents of close contact between the students who tested positive and other students on campus, Mackie said.
Other cases likely
However, Mackie also said that given the incubation period of the virus, it's likely more cases will emerge. So far however, Mackie said there's been no ""spillover"" from the student cases into London's general population.
This is the largest spike in cases in the London region since mid-August, a climb that began last week when students returned. On Sunday, the local health unit declared a community outbreak.
Two downtown bars popular with the student crowd, Lost Love and El Furniture Warehouse, closed temporarily last week.
Since cases started to increase this week, Londoners are rushing to get tested. Wait times at London's two assessment centres were not as long Thursday, running about two hours at both the Carling and Oakridge sites, compared to three hours on Wednesday.
The health unit has asked people to only get tested if they are symptomatic. The university on Friday set up a testing centre on campus.
On Tuesday, the day both centres had to turn people away because they were at capacity, the Carling site reported testing 425 people. The Oakridge facility tested 404.
Meanwhile, Ontario is reporting 293 cases of COVID-19 on Thursday. In a tweet, Health Minister Christine Elliott said that 70 per cent of the new cases were found in people under 40."

The evolving COVID-19 pandemic in Minnesota continues to change school reopening recommendations around the state.
The most recent batch of recommendations, released Thursday, cover cases from Aug. 23 to Sept. 5 — a period that happened to see a late-August spike in new COVID-19 cases.
The result? A full 25 counties saw their COVID-19 case counts slip past one of the Health Department’s thresholds, changing their recommendation toward more distance learning for more students.
In the most recent update, six counties are recommended to have all students do full-time distance learning: Blue Earth, Lyon, Stevens, Waseca, Winona and Yellow Medicine counties. All but Waseca County were previously recommended to allow at least some in-person learning.
Not every county got worse. Eleven counties saw their case rates improve compared to last week’s results, and saw their recommendation shift to more in-person learning.
Overall, 24 largely rural counties have a recommendation of in-person for all students.
A formula produced by the Health Department generates the guidance for districts to help decide whether to have in-person learning, distance learning, or a mix, based on the rate of COVID-19 cases in that district’s county over a two-week period.
These recommendations are only considered the starting point for school districts, which make their own learning plans in cooperation with the Health Department.
Minnesota’s yo-yoing COVID-19 case numbers in recent weeks have meant some drastic swings in school districts’ safe learning recommendations, but state health officials say they’re taking the data irregularities into account when working with schools to set learning plans.
Because Minnesota’s calculation uses weeks-old data and calculates cases by the day a person got tested rather than the day the tests were reported, this update is not affected by recent reporting delays caused by the Labor Day weekend.
‘We do not want that to happen here’
The new school guidance map came out the same day officials unveiled their coming monthlong push to boost testing in selected regions around the state to curb community spread of the coronavirus.
The Health Department is “deeply concerned” about the jump in community spread across Minnesota — cases where people don’t know how they contracted the disease, said Dan Huff, an assistant state health commissioner, as he explained the need to boost testing efforts.
Minnesota is seeing cases leap in neighboring states, he added, and “we do not want that to happen here.”
Here are Minnesota’s current COVID-19 statistics:
1,942 deaths
86,722 positive cases, 79,878 off isolation
242 still hospitalized, 132 in ICU
1,763,735 tests, 1,263,546 people tested
Officials are also pushing ahead on education and enforcement efforts to ensure restaurant owners and patrons comply with the state’s masking and social distancing orders.
Huff added that investigators want compliance in the “most unobtrusive way possible” but that owners and customers had a responsibility to follow the rules.
“This is a serious disease. We know that,” he said. “There’s no vaccine. There’s no cure, and it’s contagious. Everyone needs to do their part.”
‘This is not a cold’
Among their worries this week, health officials have also expressed unease about the possible resumption of football and other fall sports in the pandemic.
Minnesota has seen more than 1,400 cases of COVID-19 tied to sports activities in the pandemic, including nearly 900 in adults. Collectively, that caseload has led to recommended quarantines for more than 3,300 people.
“This is not a cold,” Dr. Ruth Lynfield, the state’s epidemiologist, warned of COVID-19. “There are some people who do fine with this, but there are others, including young people, who do not do fine.”
She noted studies showing heart and other health problems linked to COVID-19 that appear to linger beyond the infection.
“We really don’t have a sense of all the things this virus can do,” she said.
The Big Ten intends to open its season Oct. 23-24. The Minnesota State High School League expects to meet on Monday to review its earlier decision to not play football and volleyball this fall in the face of COVID-19.
While youth and college sports are important, COVID-19 poses a risk to student athletes as well as to the universe of coaches, friends and families that surround players, top state health officials said.
The Health Department was “watching with concern” the rapid growth in new COVID-19 confirmed cases in the states surrounding Minnesota and bracing for potential higher daily case counts from over the Labor Day weekend, when people ventured out for informal get-togethers with family and friends, Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said earlier this week.
The state saw a jump in cases following the July Fourth holiday. Officials also worry about a one-two punch this fall and winter from COVID-19 and the typical flu season.
On Thursday, Malcolm and Kris Ehresmann, the state’s infectious disease director, said it will take about two more weeks to determine if Labor Day gatherings led to a surge in cases.
Health Department investigators this week also going door-to-door in randomly selected neighborhoods in the Twin Cities and southeastern Minnesota as part of a statewide study to find out where COVID-19 is more prevalent.
They’ll ask questions about where people spend time, whether anyone in the house has been diagnosed with COVID-19, and what information they’d like about the virus. They’ll also offer free nasal swabs and serology tests.
College campus worries rise
People in their 20s make up the age bracket with the state’s largest number of confirmed cases — topping 20,000 since the pandemic began, including more than 11,500 infections among people ages 20-24.
The numbers help explain why experts remain particularly concerned about young adults as spreaders of the virus.
While less likely to feel the worst effects of the disease, experts worry youth and young adults will spread it to grandparents and other vulnerable populations and could also hamper attempts to reopen campuses completely to in-person teaching.
They’ve been driving the recent outbreaks, although the number of high school-age children confirmed with the disease has also grown, approaching nearly 8,000 total cases for children 15 to 19 years old since the pandemic began.
On Sunday, just across the border from Minnesota, the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse responded to rising cases by moving all in-person classes online, closing dining halls and most campus buildings, and mandating face coverings at all times on campus, indoors or outdoors.
Winona State University is in the middle of a 14-day campus quarantine that will limit all nonessential activities on campus to slow the spread of COVID-19. Winona State on Wednesday reported a current total of 125 active positive cases and 294 since late August.
Winona State, Concordia College in Moorhead and Minnesota State University Mankato have each seen more than 100 cases tied to the schools and students in the last two weeks, Ehresmann said this week.
Regionally, southern and central Minnesota and the Twin Cities suburbs have driven much of the increase in new cases while Hennepin and Ramsey counties show some of the slowest case growth in the state.
Hot spots have included southwestern Minnesota, where 75 cases have been traced to a late-August wedding in Lyon County that officials describe now as the state’s largest single social spreader event.
On Monday, Minnesota officials also confirmed an outbreak of 122 cases at the federal women’s prison in Waseca, which they said began when federal authorities transferred people into the facility from outside the state who had COVID-19.

What’s happening now
The province reported 146 new cases of COVID-19 and no new deaths on Thursday. There are 1,483 active cases in Alberta.
Alberta chief medical officer of health Dr. Deena Hinshaw announced Thursday that the province is shifting its asymptomatic testing strategy. Asymptomatic tests will be more targeted to those who most need it, including health care workers, homeless populations, teachers, and long-term care staff.
She also said Thursday that guidance on how to celebrate Halloween safely will be coming in the next few weeks.
Parents of students facing the looming possibility of quarantine if someone in their class tests positive are asking why the rules keep changing, and whether it’s necessary to miss two weeks of school if a positive case was never less than two metres away.
Alberta Health Services launched a new website for Albertans to schedule visits with loved ones at continuing care centres, AHS.ca/ccvisit. In Calgary, currently only Carewest facilities are offering online scheduling.
A member of the Mount Royal University community has tested positive, the university said in a news release. The individual was on campus last week, MRU said in the news release which didn’t specify if the individual was student or staff.
Drop-in COVID-19 testing is moving from Alberta Health Services’ Richmond Road Diagnostic and Treatment Centre to its location at the former Greyhound Bus Station, AHS announced Tuesday. The Richmond Road location will still offer testing by appointment.
City council voted Monday to extend Calgary’s mask bylaw until at least December. City councillors heard during the meeting that the bylaw might be in place until there’s a vaccine.

Alberta Teachers’ Association survey shows ‘unsustainable’ fatigue, stress and anxiety
Teachers say the stress and fatigue they’re experiencing this school year is “unsustainable,” a new survey finds.
In an Alberta Teachers’ Association (ATA) poll gauging the attitudes of 1,600 teachers towards public health guidelines in schools, a vast majority reported “extreme and unsustainable levels” of fatigue, stress and anxiety, at 94 per cent, 95 per cent and 81 per cent respectively. Teachers and school leaders were surveyed across the province Sept. 10-14.

Grocery supply chain not out of the COVID-19 woods yet: Calgary Co-op CEO
While many of the supply chain issues that dogged retailers at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic have resolved, shoppers could once again face empty grocery store shelves and shortages of staples such as yeast and toilet paper if spiking case counts lead to a second wave of the virus this fall or winter.
That’s according to Calgary Co-op CEO Ken Keelor, who has spent six months steering the city’s largest locally owned grocery retailer through the unprecedented challenge of a global pandemic.

Alberta ends broad asymptomatic testing as flu season approaches; 146 new cases
Alberta is pressing pause on asymptomatic COVID-19 testing ahead of an expected surge in demand for tests this fall.
Provincial chief medical officer of health Dr. Deena Hinshaw announced the shift in Alberta’s testing approach Thursday, saying colder weather and the return of influenza season means the province must better focus its testing resources on symptomatic and high-risk individuals.

U.S. execs reportedly granted quarantine exemption for trip to Canada in August
The CEO and two executives of an American-based corporation were given approval to bypass mandatory COVID-19 quarantine rules on a recent trip to the GTA, says a company spokesperson.
Reported Wednesday by CBC News, Liz Uihlein — president and CEO of Wisconsin-based Uline, Inc. — was granted a Canadian government exemption for her and two senior executives to conduct a two-day site visit at the company’s Milton, Ont. plant late last month without undergoing the mandatory 14-day quarantine.

Quarantine rules tightened in schools as COVID cases, outbreaks keep rising
Parents of students facing the looming possibility of quarantine if someone in their class tests positive are asking why the rules keep changing, and whether it’s necessary to miss two weeks of school if a positive case was never less than two metres away.
With up to 77 schools across the province now reporting cases, including seven outbreaks in Calgary, school districts are now warning that every student in the class of someone who has tested positive will have to stay away from school for two weeks and transition to online learning.

Marni Soupcoff: Withholding rapid COVID-19 testing just doesn’t make sense
Columnist Marni Soupcoff writes: Health Minister Patty Hajdu’s statement Wednesday that Canada is not ready to use rapid COVID-19 testing tools sounded reasonable enough.
Health Canada has not seen an antigen test that meets its standards yet, she said. She noted that COVID-19 tests that are not accurate enough for regulators could cause harm by giving people a false sense of security. “The holdup is the technology,” she explained. It is just not there yet. A pity. If only.
All this starts to sound less coherent when checked against the reality public health experts are presenting. Hajdu makes it sound as though creating a usable quick test will be a herculean scientific task that could take years. Harvard epidemiologist Michael Mina, who recently appeared on Malcolm Gladwell’s Solvable podcast, notes that not only does the technology for inexpensive paper-strip antigen testing already exist, we use it all the time.
Alberta outlines government-wide strategy for attracting new investment to province
Alberta is promising a government-wide strategy to attract investment to the province, and sector-specific investments to help the economy recover as Canada emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic.
“We have to be able to keep up with a very fast economy that is ever-changing,” said Doug Schweitzer, the minister of jobs, economy and innovation, in an interview with the National Post on Thursday. “We have to make sure that we’re there to complement and keep up with the speed of the private sector.”

146 new cases
Alberta chief medical officer of health Dr. Deena Hinshaw provided an update on the COVID-19 pandemic.
146 new cases on 13,003 tests
No new deaths; 254 total
41 in hospital; 8 in ICUs
1,483 active cases province-wide
Alberta Health Services has recorded 64 cases present at 48 schools “while infectious,” Hinshaw said
10 outbreaks of two or more cases in schools across province
No evidence of in-school transmission yet, Hinshaw said, but she expects it will come eventually
233,000 asymptomatic tests since May 29, only seven per 10,000 have come back positive. “That means it is very rare to find cases in those without symptoms and with no known exposure,” Hinshaw said
Testing strategy will shift in the winter: broad asymptomatic testing will be put on pause, with a shift to targeted testing for priority groups like health care workers, homeless populations, teachers, long-term care staff
Tests will still be widely available for those with symptoms, those who are close contacts of known cases, those associated with outbreaks
“Halloween is certainly not cancelled, it will look different this year,” Hinshaw said. She said they haven’t finished their guidance on it yet and it will be released in the coming weeks

Ontario cuts social gathering numbers in three regions, brings in $10,000 fines for rule violators
Ontario is lowering the number of people permitted at social gatherings in three regions that have recently seen a spike in COVID-19 cases.
The change will only affect Toronto, Peel Region, and Ottawa, and will not apply to businesses like restaurants, movie theatres, or banquet halls.
Premier Doug Ford says starting Friday only 10 people will be allowed to gather indoors, down from the current limit of 25, while the number for outdoor gatherings will drop from the 100 to 25.
Fines for the organizers of events that violate the new rules will be a minimum of $10,000, while those attending the gatherings will face $750 fines.

In England, parents despair at COVID dilemma as testing system buckles
Parents across England are facing a COVID-19 dilemma: their children are not allowed to return to school unless they have a negative coronavirus test, but it is fiendishly difficult to get one as the British testing system buckles.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who in May promised to create a “world beating” system to test and trace people exposed to the virus, said he sympathized with those unable to get a test but that the system was struggling with massive demand.
Across England, though, parents were frustrated.
Vinay Guwant, 44, said his son had developed a cough over the weekend and that his school had said he could only return if he had a negative test result.
For three days, Guwant repeatedly tried and failed to get a test, waking up in the early hours and staying up past midnight to navigate the government’s website and search for a test.

Saddle Ridge School reports single COVID-19 case; outbreak reported at Okotoks school
An individual from Saddle Ridge School in the city’s northeast has been diagnosed with COVID-19.
A note sent to parents on Tuesday does not specify if the individual is a student or staff member.
An outbreak has also been declared at Foothills Composite High School in Okotoks after two cases were confirmed. The school remains open.
Saddle Ridge is the 22rd Calgary school to report a case since Aug. 31. Seven Calgary schools have reported outbreaks of two or more cases. Across Alberta, 12 schools have reported outbreaks of two or more cases, or in one case a “watch” of five or more cases.

Positive case on MRU campus
A member of the Mount Royal University has tested positive for COVID-19.
The individual was on campus last week, MRU said Wednesday in a news release which didn’t specify whether the individual was student or staff.
MRU said in the release that they’ve been in contact with Alberta Health Services to notify other members of the MRU community who were in contact with the person and the unidentified positive individual has also notified others who were in contact with them. The individual is self-isolating, the release said.
“While it is concerning to have a case on campus, it is not surprising and it is realistic to expect that despite our best efforts there may be more confirmed cases as the semester continues,” MRU said in the news release.

The 11 include five outbreaks considered by the state's health department as new and six deemed ongoing, and the positive case counts were as small as two and as large as six.
All were much less than what has been recorded this fall semester at Michigan's universities and colleges. Grand Valley State University, for example, has had 438 positive cases, and Michigan State University and Central Michigan University have both reported spikes in cases since students returned.
The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services identified the K-12 schools with COVID-19 outbreaks for the first time on Monday, although the data lags identification of cases by several days.
Among them, Luce Road Elementary in Alma has the most reported illnesses — six cases — in its preschool and elementary school program, impacting both students and staff there.
Alma Schools Superintendent Donalynn Ingersoll sent parents an email on Sept. 5 informing them of a second positive case of COVID-19 within a first-grade classroom at Luce Road Early Childhood Learning Center.
""Under the direction of the MidMichigan Health Department, we believe the safest action at this time is to close Luce Road School for a 14 day period, from the date of last possible exposure (September 3),"" Ingersoll said in the letter. ""Beginning Tuesday, September 8, Alma’s Kindergarten and first grade students will transition to Panthers On-Line.""
The district provided names and contact information of potential close contacts to health officials and said COVID-19 cleaning and disinfecting protocols would continue to be followed, Ingersoll said. The entire school was deep-cleaned and disinfected following COVID-19 exposure protocols during the closure and students are expected to return to school on Friday.
Four other K-12 schools, none in Metro Detroit, also recently reported new outbreaks.
They include: Keicher Elementary in Michigan Center, two cases among preschool/elementary staff; Arrowwood Elementary in Saginaw, four cases among preschool/elementary staff; Parkside Elementary in Rockford, two cases among preschool/elementary staff; Thornapple Kellogg Middle School in Middleville, two cases among junior high/middle school students.
State health officials announced ""in an effort to provide accurate and timely information about COVID-19 in Michigan schools,"" the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services will begin reporting outbreak information by school building.
A COVID-19 outbreak is defined as two or more cases with a link by place and time indicating a shared exposure outside of a household.
The information being posted on the website at 3 p.m. each Monday will include K-12, college and university school name, address, number of cases and if the cases involved staff, students or both, state health officials said.

Students or staff exposed to COVID-19 outside the school building and are not thought to have spread the virus in the school due to quarantine or self-isolation are not included in the data.
“Parents and students should know that if their school is listed, their local health department and school are already investigating. Based on that investigation, people are contacted individually if they were possibly exposed to COVID-19 at school,” said Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, chief medical executive and chief deputy for health for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.
“Michigan schools are working hard to maintain a safe environment while also providing quality education.""
New and ongoing outbreaks are counted only once. Ongoing cases are those reported as of Sept. 10. Ongoing outbreaks are defined by state health officials as those that had already been identified in previous weeks but have had at least one new associated case reported to the local health department in the last two weeks.
For K-12 ongoing outbreaks, there are several in Lower Michigan. They include:
Oakland Christian Elementary School in Auburn Hills has four cases in its preschool/elementary staff and student body; Bright Beginnings in Morrice has three cases among students; the Birmingham Groves Big Brother Big Sister Program at its high school has two cases among students; Notre Dame Preparatory School in Pontiac has three student cases; Jenison High School in Jenison has two cases among students and staff; the St. Clair County RESA in Marysville has three cases among staff at its high school.
Andy Guest, head of school at Notre Dame Preparatory School and Marist Academy, said the private Oakland County school has had three students test positive for COVID-19 since it opened in August.
""Today, we have zero active cases of COVID-19, and there has been no indication of community spread,"" Guest said in a statement Monday.
""We continue to remain vigilant with our cleaning, sanitation, hygiene, screening and mask protocols outlined in our return-to-school plan and are in adherence to Archdiocese of Detroit guidelines and the MI Safe School Roadmap for the safe reopening of schools.”
Guest said the school is tracking all positive cases, reporting those cases to the Oakland County Health Division, assisting in contact tracing, and quarantining students who might have been exposed to a positive case.
All three cases were reported by a parent who had sought out a test on his or her own for their child, he said.
After performing the contact tracing, the school determined 30 students needed to quarantine at home. None had symptoms and none became sick, Guest said. They all returned to school on Monday.
The fact that none fell ill ""leads us to believe there was no community spread,"" Guest said.
Brad Jernigan has a son in the high school where the positive cases were. Jernigan said Notre Dame used the contact tracing tool through Oakland County to identify which students might have been exposed, and those students were immediately sent home.
""In each case, there was no spread because of the way it was quickly handled, so we are very comfortable in the way the school has been handling it,"" Jernigan said.
Anne Cron, a spokeswoman for the Birmingham school district where Groves is located, said Monday the cases occurred on Aug. 17 at a senior registration event at Groves and Aug. 19 at a Big Brothers Big Sisters mentor training event at Beverly Park.
Emails were sent to parents to inform them of the cases.
""In both situations, we communicated with participants immediately to alert them of the potential exposure and worked with OCHD to provide additional information to assist with contact tracing,"" Cron said. ""In both instances, OCHD determined that no further exposure occurred for our participants, as safety protocols were in place.""
The names of schools where COVID-19 outbreaks have occurred, as well as whether the cases involved staff, students or both, will be reported every Monday by state health officials, a departure from past practices when outbreak information was released only by region.

State health officials said if a school is listed, local health departments and schools are investigating and will contact families directly if their child was possibly exposed to coronavirus at school.
Data on COVID-19 outbreaks are being collected weekly from the 45 local health departments across the state.
State health officials said many factors, including the lack of ability to conduct effective contact tracing in certain settings, might result in underreporting of outbreaks.
""This information does not provide a complete picture of school outbreaks in Michigan and the absence of identified outbreaks in a school does not mean it is not experiencing an outbreak,"" the health department said in a statement.
This comes as about 86% of Michigan school districts are offering some or all instruction in person at the beginning of the school year, according to a study by Michigan State University’s Education Policy Innovation Collaborative.
The study found 59% of Michigan school districts are offering students an option to return to school five days a week and 27% of districts are providing children with the ability to return to schools at least two to three days a week.

10,https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-09-tool-covid-outbreaks-counties.html,0.667,New tool can detect COVID-19 outbreaks in U.S. counties,"A new machine learning-based online tool developed by researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Harvard Medical School (HMS), Georgia Tech and Boston Medical Center allows for early detection of COVID-19 outbreaks in different U.S. counties. The COVID-19 Outbreak Detection Tool is updated two-to-three times per week and it predicts how fast an outbreak is spreading within a given county by estimating the doubling time of COVID-19 cases.
To make these predictions, the tool accounts for reported COVID-19 cases and deaths, face mask mandates, social distancing policies, changes in tests performed, rates of positive tests and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Social Vulnerability Index (which assesses the health-related resilience of individual communities when confronted with external stresses, such as natural or human-caused disasters or disease outbreaks).
The tool offers an interactive map and a ""data explorer"" that allows users to select a specific county to see that county's population, total new cases of COVID-19 in the past week, average daily cases in the past week, and the COVID-19 doubling rate (i.e., how many days it takes for the number of cases to double in a given county).
""While earlier mitigation responses focused on state-level measures—such as a lockdown of an entire state—detecting local outbreaks will allow policy makers to implement measures at the county level—such as closing restaurants in a single county—to effectively contain the pandemic,"" said Jagpreet Chhatwal, Ph.D., the associate director at the MGH Institute for Technology Assessment and an assistant professor at HMS. ""The model is able to detect many of the prior outbreaks within a matter of days.""
""For effectively controlling the pandemic, it is critical to detect an outbreak in a timely manner so that the affected area can be isolated and the spread of COVID-19 infections to neighboring areas can be minimized; however, due to several reasons, it may take days or even weeks for humans to manually detect an outbreak. Our data-driven machine learning–based solution significantly speeds up and automates that process,"" said Turgay Ayer, Ph.D., the director of Business Intelligence and Healthcare Analytics at the Center for Health and Humanitarian Systems and an associate professor at Georgia Tech.
Using the COVID-19 Outbreak Tool, the research team verified an outbreak in Johnson county in Iowa last week, which was linked to an outbreak at the University of Iowa. In addition, the tool identified several counties where outbreaks could be happening now. These include Harrisonburg County in Virginia, Wheeler County in Georgia, Monroe County in Indiana and Whitman County in Washington, where infections are doubling in less than one week.

They say so far, it seems to be subsiding.
“Temple University conducted testing over the weekend, they did about 150 students per day and saw a decrease in the percentage of those students who tested positive each day. So far, there is no evidence of a spread from Temple University population to other populations in the city, that is a very good thing,” said Philadelphia Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas Farley.

8:30 a.m. and some students have yet to wake up to start their day.
So outflow of wastewater at this dorm is a little low. So Jeff Bilzinck is getting a smaller bottle to scoop a little poop, so to speak. Not that you’d be able to tell by looking at it
“Everyone’s disappointed when it’s not all gross,”Bilzinck said.
Bilzinck and his coworker Nick are collecting wastewater from across campus, for this man, So he can test it for COVID-19.
“Hi, I’m Dr. Pepper.”
No, not that Dr. Pepper. Dr. Ian Pepper is a different kind of liquid genius.
“I’m the director of the Water and Energy Sustainable Technology Center,” said Pepper.
Dr. Pepper and his team have been testing wastewater for the coronavirus since students came back to campus and early in the school year, stopped a potential outbreak. After wastewater from a dorm came back positive, school officials tested the students living there and identified two asymptomatic students.
“The trick is by identifying the asymptomatic cases early, we are, if not eliminating, we are reducing exponential spread of the virus,” said Pepper.
Wastewater testing is gaining some steam in the scientific community outside of Arizona.
“We as individuals, humans, shed these virus in fecal material,” said Kellog Schwab, the director of the Water Institute at Johns Hopkins University.
He has been studying wastewater virology for 30 years. He says what they’re doing in Arizona is complicated.
“It is not straight forward. There are a lot of interfering substances as you can imagine in a waste stream that you have to then purify the virus from. It’s not just you grab a sample from a particular part of the environment and then instantly be able to detect the virus. You need to process that sample, you need to maintain the integrity of your target of interest, and then you have to have the appropriate detection,” said Schwab.
But he and Dr. Pepper agree that this type of testing could be scaled up and implemented at universities and other populated facilities where COVID-19 could potentially spread.
“Wastewater epidemiology has the potential to be scalable,” said Schwab.
“Perhaps targeting high-risk areas like nursing homes. We’re helping people in Yuma, Arizona, testing our farm workers when they come here in the fall, so there’s a great deal of potential,” said Pepper.
“Many research laboratories have the capacity to do this,” said Schwab.
That potential to expand this type of testing, and keep people safe, keeps Pepper going.
“We are keeping the university open, which is really important. And, you know, dare I say, actually, probably saving lives,” said Pepper.
Saving lives and closing the lid on the coronavirus."

According to this data, most of the outbreaks are coming from higher education institutions with Grand Valley State University reporting the highest number of cases.
The Allendale-based university has been reporting the total number of active cases on its website. The school's dashboard shows there are 419 actives cases between staff, on-campus and off-campus students. The state's website lists 438. There is a positivity rate of about 3%.
The second largest school-related outbreak is at Central Michigan University where there are 271 students who have tested positive.
Michigan State University, the largest college in the state, reports 203 cases. Ingham County ordered a two-week quarantine for 23 Greek houses and seven rental properties near the school that were exposed to COVID-19. The University of Michigan reports 77 active cases.
An outbreak is defined as a two or more cases who may have shared exposure on the school's campus.
On Sept. 10, the GVSU Virus Action Team posted an update on the surge in cases since classes started on Aug. 31.
""It has been reported that Grand Valley has the highest number of COVID cases among Michigan’s public universities. This is because we count the known condition of all our students, while many other colleges count only the students living on campus,"" said Greg Sanial, vice president for Finance and Administration and interim director of the Virus Action Team . ""If we reported only our on-campus numbers, we would have one of the lowest numbers of reported cases.""
Student Leah Erben, a senior, says the school recently sent students an email explaining the cases as a result of more testing.
""I don't really know who the believe, honestly,"" said Erben. ""It feels like the university is kind of desperately trying to convince us that we're okay.""
Brian Hartl, an epidemiologist with the Kent County Health Department, says while there aren't any campuses the size of GVSU in Kent County, the 19 to 24 age group has still spiked in positive cases over the last few weeks.
""They like to hang out, they like to get together, they like to have some beverages that kind of limits their inhibitions,"" said Hartl. ""Anytime you bring people close together, it heightens the risk for COVID transmission.""
The Ottawa County Health Department said they are working with the leaders of GVSU to prepare more ""community mitigation strategies"" because of the outbreak in Allendale. They said more details will be released on Wednesday, Sept. 16.

The system makes its assessments by analyzing reported COVID-19 cases and deaths, rates of positive tests, face mask rules, social distancing policies, and changes in testing.
It also incorporates the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Social Vulnerability Index, which assesses how individual communities are prepared for hazardous events based on factors including poverty and population density.
It then predicts how fast the virus is spreading by estimating how many days it will take for the number of cases to double.
The forecasts are displayed on an interactive heat map that shows each county’s doubling rate. Users can also see the area’s population, new cases, and average daily cases, all of which is updated two-to-three times per week.
The system was developed by researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Georgia Tech, and Boston Medical Center. Jagpreet Chhatwal, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, said it could reduce the spread of infections by identifying COVID-19 hotspots to isolate from their neighbors:
While earlier mitigation responses focused on state-level measures — such as a lockdown of an entire state — detecting local outbreaks will allow policymakers to implement measures at the county level — such as closing restaurants in a single county — to effectively contain the pandemic. The model is able to detect many of the prior outbreaks within a matter of days.
In tests, the tool verified an outbreak last week in Johnson county Iowa, which was linked to a surge in cases at the University of Iowa. It also identified several counties where potential outbreaks could be happening now, including Harrisonburg County in Virginia, Wheeler County in Georgia, Monroe County in Indiana, and Whitman County in Washington.

Officials of the private university said they have linked a spike of the coronavirus to off-campus gatherings. The Peoria university is requiring students to limit nonessential interactions, stay in their off-campus apartments, residence halls or Greek houses and take classes remotely beginning Tuesday.
In announcing the measure, the university said it has tallied about 50 COVID-19 cases so far, adding emergency measures are needed to respond to the outbreak without disrupting academic progress.
“Although it may seem extreme, this move to temporary remote learning and a two-week, all-student quarantine allows us to focus on the continuity of the educational experience for all of our students while giving us time to gather data on the full extent of the spread of the virus and assess the best way to proceed as a community,” Bradley President Stephen Standifird said in a message to students.
Most of those who tested positive are asymptomatic carriers and others have experienced mild symptoms, Standifird said. More than 500 students were in quarantine as of Tuesday morning.
While about 4,600 undergraduates were enrolled at Bradley last year, it wasn’t immediately known how many are enrolled this fall.

As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, Chatham High School has turned to virtual classes for two weeks, according to a letter dated Sept. 11 from the superintendent of Chatham School District.
AMID CORONAVIRUS, IS IT SAFE TO SEND CHILDREN BACK TO SCHOOL? EXPERTS, PARENTS WEIGH IN
“Based on its contact tracing process, the Department of Health believes there was likely active transmission of the virus at a non-school event over the weekend, though it is possible that there may have been other gatherings during or before the weekend where transmission could have occurred. Based on the ongoing nature of this turn of events, Chatham High School will remain on virtual instruction for the next two weeks. We will plan for in-person instruction to resume on Sept. 29,"" Michael LaSusa, the superintendent, stated in the letter.
“All extracurricular activities are also suspended during this time,"" he added.
The superintendent credited safety measures put in place for preventing transmission of the virus in school.
“The Department of Health officials indicated that they believe the mitigation strategies implemented in school, particularly the wearing of face coverings, make it unlikely that transmission took place within school this week. They also indicated that they believe the early action and response on the part of a number of students and parents has been helpful in addressing this situation quickly,"" he said in the letter.
Chatham Mayor Thaddeus Kobylarz and Police Chief Brian Gibbons expressed their frustration during a Borough Council meeting Monday night, saying the Sept. 6 back-to-school party was “unwisely held,” according to a report in the Chatham Courier. The school closed on Sept. 10, just two days into the school semester, according to the report.
""At least nine of these students are in Chatham Borough,"" Kobylarz said during the meeting, according to the article. ""We do not know how big this outbreak will be. We do not know how many secondary infections there will be.”
""We are deeply troubled by this incident. We are especially concerned for children and older household members. We are concerned that this kind of self-inflicted injury would occur here in Chatham Borough,"" Kobylarz stated during the meeting.
The mayor asked the public to maintain social distancing and wear a mask.
“Most of all, avoid these unnecessary large gatherings where you don't know if someone is infected or not,” he added, per the report.
""This could be a matter of life or death,"" he was quoted as saying.
""It was in very poor judgment to hold the party right before school. It was selfish on the part of the parents. This undermines all the efforts the school district has taken to get school back on track,"" Gibbons said during the council meeting, per the local media outlet.
The report also said the police chief stated there will be an investigation, noting that ""this is about protecting families from a terrible disease. I think it could be a case of criminal liability.”

Town officials strongly recommended during the meeting that the public cooperate with contact tracing efforts and self-quarantine to contain the virus outbreak, the media report said.
Meanwhile, LaSusa, the superintendent, said in his letter that the school will be sanitizing and ventilating all classrooms and spaces over the two-week period. It plans to reopen on Sept. 29.

According to a letter sent to parents shared with the Star, the York Memorial Collegiate Institute announced Thursday that one of their students had tested positive for the virus.
“We have no reason to believe there is any cause for concern for students and their families as this student was very briefly at the school on Monday, was not at school today and will not return until cleared by TPH,” wrote Donna Drummond, principal of the public secondary school, in the letter.
As of Thursday, eight schools have announced COVID-19 cases in the Toronto region. All have one case each. Seven are staff members, and one a student.
TDSB spokesperson Ryan Bird told the Star that, while Toronto secondary schools are opening their doors to all students on Thursday, students in Toronto’s Special Education Congregated Sites and Intensive Support Programs began their classes earlier on Tuesday.
The affected student went to school “briefly” on Monday before the start of full-time classes, Bird said.
The school is “working closely with Toronto Public Health (TPH) with regard to this case,” according to Drummond’s letter.
“As a precaution, an enhanced cleaning was conducted in the impacted areas but no further steps have been advised by TPH at this time,” Drummond said.
However, because the case was discovered before the first day of class, parents won’t be getting a letter from Toronto Public Health, she continued.
“We just wanted to let you know about this particular case as it must be reported to the Ministry of Education and Toronto Public Health.”
Alexander Brown, chair of the TDSB, said it’s not unexpected that there is a student case of COVID-19, and said the board continues to follow Toronto Public Health’s lead.
Local health units have the power to shut down schools if there are multiple, linked cases. That happened in Renfrew County on Wednesday after three staffers contracted the virus, forcing Fellowes High School in Pembroke to close until further notice.
Given the higher numbers of COVID-19 cases in urban centres such as Toronto, “parents are worried ‘is there going to be an outbreak at my school?’ Brown said. “Our concern at the TDSB — and it’s the concern of every board — is to keep the health and safety of kids and everyone in the building our priority, whatever that takes.”
Experts said earlier that it’s expected for schools to report COVID-19 cases as soon as they reopen. This doesn’t indicate in-class spread, but rather community cases from before classes reopened.
Earlier in August, several Ontario teachers unions advocated for smaller class sizes, including plans to shrink elementary classes down to 15 or 20 students. However, the Province struck down the idea.
Leslie Wolfe, president of the Ontario Secondary School Teachers’ Federation in Toronto, told the Star: “I’m concerned for the wellbeing of students. I’m very concerned for the wellbeing of the adults who work with the students,” she said. Several of her union members are older, she continued, and Wolfe is “concerned for their health.
“I don’t think anyone will be surprised at the fact that there is a student case in the city of Toronto,” she said. “And I expect this will not be a one-off.”

""At least a third of new cases recently attended parties or social gatherings, and at least one third of those gatherings are associated with a fraternity or sorority,"" the Ingham County Health Department said in a statement.
The hundreds of new Covid-19 cases involving people affiliated to the university date to August 24, the health department said. Only 23 people had tested positive before that date.
""This is an urgent situation,"" said Ingham County Health Officer Linda S. Vail. ""The exponential growth of COVID-19 cases must stop.""
The outbreak started as students returned to the East Lansing area for the fall semester, the department said. Most MSU classes are online but ""many students had binding off-campus leases or simply desired to physically return to the university community.""
""MSU is committed to doing everything we can to prevent the spread of COVID-19,"" Michigan State University Physician David Weismantel said in the statement. ""The safety of our entire community is a priority and we all have a role to play in preventing the spread of the virus. This recommendation from the health department is another tool to help us do just that.""
The quarantine recommendation isn't an ""emergency order,"" but the health department warned that ""more stringent and mandatory restrictions will be imposed if students do not comply and break the transmission cycle.""
The health department said it will look at houses licensed for more than 10 unrelated people ""to see if additional measures are warranted.""
""I am concerned about the health and safety of the MSU community and importantly, I am seriously concerned that unchecked transmission locally will affect the health and safety of all Ingham County residents,"" Vail said.
East Lansing Mayor Aaron Stephens, in a statement, urged students to consider their role in halting the ""community spread and, ultimately, saving lives.""
He added: ""We are still seeing far too many social gatherings in the off-campus community, where individuals are in close contact without face coverings.""
Students are asked to self-quarantine for 14 days, until 11:59 p.m. on Saturday, September 26. They are permitted to attend ""in-person instruction, labs, and intercollegiate athletic training,"" the health department said.
""They may also leave their homes to work or to obtain food, medicine, medical care, or supplies that are needed to sustain or protect life when such cannot be obtained via delivery,"" the health department added.
The entire MSU football team was placed under 14-day quarantine on July 23 after a second staff member and student-athlete tested positive for Covid-19."

The school in London, Ont., said most of the 28 students who received positive tests live off-campus, though one is in isolation in residence.
""We know our students desperately want to have some on-campus experiences. But, unfortunately, this development means we will be limiting those experiences,"" said Alan Shepard, president of Western.
The news comes just days after Western students flooded a testing site upon receiving word that five students had tested positive. The centre reached its capacity within two hours of opening on Monday.
Days before that, images and videos of people partying — and tagging Western University — popped up on social media sites including Instagram and TikTok.
""The vast majority of the transmission looks like it happened off campus — either at house parties or in local bars,"" Shepard said in an interview. ""So there's really no evidence of on-campus transmission.""
He said the school felt it important to send a strong message to students that COVID-19 is serious, so administrators decided to roll back to what they call ""Western Stage 3.""
The school suspended athletics and recreation, as well as in-person club meetings and events. Access to libraries and several other buildings is also restricted, though on-campus classes continue, with about 25 per cent of courses having an in-person component. Residences are also still open.
Dr. David Williams, the province's chief medical officer of health, said he's glad students are getting tested, but there's room for improvement on campus.
""We've seen some clusters of cases and individuals who in their ... first number of days back at the campus would seem to have let down their guard a bit and have had some events and activities,"" he said.
Matt Reesor, president of Western University Students' Council, said that while the outbreak is disappointing, it doesn't reflect the attitude of the student body at large.
""Based on my time on campus and throughout my conversations with students, it is clear that most students are abiding by health and safety guidelines and understand that preventing the spread of COVID-19 is a shared responsibility,"" Reesor said in a statement.
He said the council is now working with the school and public health officials to get that message across to those who have been ignoring it.
Western, like its rival Queen's University in Kingston, Ont., is also warning it will crack down on those who put the health of others at risk.
The school noted in a statement that students violating the rules could be referred for review under the student code of conduct.
It's a complaint-based process, Shepard noted, and students have the right to defend themselves, so it remains to be seen whether such a review would result in serious consequences.
But he said in the most serious cases, students could see complaints brought against them.
""Being an educational institution, we're trying to educate people rather than punish them whenever possible,"" Shepard said.

Over the roughly week and a half that Ian Katsnelson has been back at his college, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, the junior has developed a “mini competition” with his friends to see who can finish the process of taking their COVID-19 tests the fastest.
“The hardest part for sure is garnering enough saliva,” Katsnelson said of the rapid saliva test, which was created by scientists at the school. He’s perfecting his strategy for his trips to the tents where testing takes place: “I’ve built up my saliva in line before I’ve even gotten inside the tent, so I can get in and get out real quick.”
Hallie Workman, a PhD candidate in communications at U of I said, “there’s a lot of scouting that goes on” as students try to find out which of the more than a dozen testing tents on campus have the shortest line.
“I have my tent in my time of day that always works well,” Workman, 30, said. “You just sit there trying not to make eye contact with people as you dribble spit into a tube.”
These were just some of the rituals that marked an unusual first week of classes at the University of Illinois, which is requiring students, faculty and staff accessing campus to get tested for COVID-19 twice a week as part of its reopening plan.
‘A defining moment’ for the school
As colleges across the country have sent students home or back to remote classes amid COVID outbreaks, officials at the University of Illinois are hopeful that their approach to mitigating the pandemic’s spread on campus — which includes a test developed at the school that is now being performed under the Federal Drug Administration’s emergency use authorization — will be enough to keep students in some in-person classes through November. It’s not a small undertaking. The school had 51,000 students in the fall of 2019.
Since July 6, the school has processed 121,333 COVID tests and in the five days leading up to Friday, which marked the end of the first week of classes, the school administered 47,075 tests and had a 0.75% positivity rate. For context, there were roughly 730,000 COVID tests administered in the entire U.S. on a recent August day, according to Johns Hopkins University’s Coronavirus Resource Center. On Aug. 24, U of I administered more than 17,000 tests alone.
So far, the number of positive cases is in line with what the school’s modelers predicted — well under 400 cases in the week before classes began. The next couple of weeks will be a “defining moment” for U of I as it works to prevent the spread of COVID-19 on campus and in the community, said Robert Jones, the school’s chancellor.
“We know that people are watching,” he told MarketWatch.
And indeed, according to Joshua Salomon, the director of the Prevention Policy Modeling Lab at Stanford University, “people are really going to be watching this carefully,” describing the efforts the school has taken as “encouraging.”
“We don’t know whether it’s going to succeed,” he added. “What we do know is that the likelihood of succeeding without testing is very small.”
U of I is likely the only university testing students at this frequency
At many universities that have reopened their campuses for in-person instruction, students may have been tested upon reentry to university housing or campus more broadly and may be subject to random screening. But models from researchers at Yale School of Public Health and U of I, indicate that in order to prevent an outbreak on a college campus — and not just monitor one — students and those interacting with them regularly need to be tested multiple times per week.
U of I may be the only university in the country hewing to that standard. Officials will know around Sept. 25, one month and one day after the start of classes, if their efforts have worked, said Rebecca Lee Smith, an associate professor of pathobiology at U of I who is part of the team that developed the school’s testing and other protocols.
“We’re going to be keeping track of how well we’re doing going from test results to isolation to contact tracing and quarantine,” Smith said. They’ll also be looking out for new positive cases, a sign of community spread. The outcome that they’re hoping for “is to minimize the infections, get it under control and to protect the health of campus and the community,” Smith said.
The school began working to prepare for the fall semester shortly after classes went remote in the spring, said Martin Burke, a chemistry professor at the University of Illinois and chair of the SHIELD committee, the team that is guiding the university’s approach to reopening. They realized relatively quickly that in order to bring students back to campus, they would need to test frequently and get results back rapidly, something that wasn’t going to be possible with a nasal swab test.
That led to what Burke described as a “Manhattan Project-style effort,” at the university to develop their own test. Ultimately they were able to do so in about six weeks, he said. Now the school is working to expand access to the test to the rest of the state of Illinois and even to other areas of the country and around the world.
“Testing is not a silver bullet, but it’s a very powerful component,” Burke said.
In addition to the testing, the school developed an app where students, faculty and staff receive test results and reminders, and a boarding pass-style image indicating a negative COVID test that allow them access to campus buildings. Users can also enable the app to notify them when they’ve been in close proximity to someone who tested positive for COVID through the use of an anonymized Bluetooth scanning system.
U of I is also taking many of the same steps as other campuses — moving large lecture courses online, moving smaller in-person courses to large rooms to allow for social distancing and requiring masks. The school also has “every high expectation” of students, Jones said. “By agreeing to come back and be here that they have to take ownership to keep themselves safe.” Those who are participating in on-campus activities and don’t follow testing and isolation guidelines could be subject to student discipline.
‘We’re still very much in the middle of a raging pandemic’
For a university to have a shot at reopening successfully, it needs to hold classes online or outside when possible, have a good system for testing and contact tracing, and have clear and transparent metrics for when it will change course, Salomon said. (Asked about what would trigger a move to remote instruction, Jones said “one of the key metrics, we’re keeping our eye on is the number of positive cases.”)
All of these are costly and administratively challenging undertakings. Jones said his best “guesstimate” is that the school’s testing component alone will cost $7 to $10 million per semester. But a major obstacle to any successful reopening, is just the status of the spread of the virus itself, Salomon said.
“We’re still very much in the middle of a raging pandemic,” he said. “With that amount of transmission in communities and bringing together students from around the country, we know that there will be people infected upon arrival. It raises the bar on what needs to be done to interrupt transmission and cut it off.”
Called an audible and held class on Zoom
During the first week of classes, when the school onboarded tens of thousands of students, “the main hiccup” in its system was turning test results around fast enough so that students, faculty and staff would have access to buildings they needed to be in for class, Smith said. Those who haven’t had a negative test result in the last four days can’t get into university buildings, except their own residence hall. Still, the school has been turning test results around “well within” the 48 hour window they’ve promised, she said.
Workman was one of those affected by the hiccup. She got tested on a Monday, which was one of the testing days assigned to her by the school, but didn’t get her results back in time to teach her 8 a.m. Tuesday class in person. She “had to call an audible and tell my class we were meeting on Zoom.”
When the two public speaking classes she was teaching started last week, roughly 5% of her students couldn’t attend because they’d tested positive for the virus, Workman said. That’s one metric Workman said she’ll be keeping an eye on as she evaluates whether to keep teaching in person. If enough students can’t attend class face-to-face because of quarantine or isolation, she’ll transition to remote instruction, though her preference is to continue teaching in-person classes — the widespread testing has made her feel comfortable doing so.
Owen Stephenson was eager to come to campus for his freshman year to gain some independence, even if he would be taking most of his classes online. So far, he’s felt like the testing has gone smoothly; he received his first two test results on the same day he tested and his only quibble was a 45-minute wait on a weekend, when there are fewer testing tents available.
The required testing is part of what makes Stephenson feel like he can keep himself safe, regardless of other students’ behavior. “Their testing is the only thing that sets them apart from other universities trying to go back,” he said of U of I’s plan.
From her observations in class, Workman said it seems as if students are committed to making the school’s reopening program work because they want to stick around for the semester. Still, she said, the changes to the college experience required during this time — more rules for engaging on campus, more online courses than typical — have left her students so drained that she ended a recent class 20 minutes early.
“They had this feeling that once they were finally able to get back on campus, that life would feel more normal and it’s not.”"

The Department of Public Health confirmed 166 additional cases of Covid-19, marking the second day in a row the city has seen high new case counts after 235 were announced Wednesday.
Some affected people in the case surge were tested last week and are now being identified as Philadelphia residents, Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas Farley said. A complete count of cases associated with the Temple University outbreak isn’t available, he noted, as some instances are reported with a student’s home address outside of the college area.
Farley still believes much of the increase across the city in the past week is linked to Temple's outbreak, following a statewide and national trend in coronavirus surges tied to college campuses, he said. Based on data from the week ending Aug. 28, Philadelphia has an average of 108 new Covid cases per day with a 4.1% positive testing rate.
As of Thursday afternoon, Temple indicated 236 students and one university employee had tested positive for Covid-19.
During a press conference Thursday, Mayor Jim Kenney said the school decided to move classes online based on the data available and without pressure from the city.
City officials also reminded residents of Temple University’s efforts to help mitigate the spread of Covid-19 in Philadelphia, including converting its Liacouras Center into a temporary coronavirus overflow medical facility during the peak of the local health crisis in spring.
Restaurants in Philadelphia can move ahead with plans to jumpstart indoor dining at 25% capacity the day after Labor Day weekend, while movie theaters must not exceed 50% occupancy and also can allow no more than 25 people at a screening.
The greenlight for indoor dining comes as the Rittenhouse Square neighborhood expands outdoor dining options this weekend with temporary street closures and Center City ramps up for its Restaurant Week running Sept. 13-25.
Kenney, who came under fire this week for dining indoors in Maryland while the service was still prohibited in Philly, said he doesn’t anticipate Restaurant Week will increase the risk of Covid-19 spread.
“If the [restaurant] capacities are the same as they are and the requirements for indoor dining and all the protocols are followed, it should be as safe as possible,” Kenney said.
Meanwhile, city officials also fielded questions about the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's notice to states urging them to prepare a strategy for distribution of a potential vaccine to vulnerable populations as soon as late October or early November.
A vaccine is not yet a certainty and the city has seen no data about safety or effectiveness, Farley said. When that data becomes available he noted the city will work with health experts to formulate a recommendation on the vaccine’s use.
To meet the fall timeline, the vaccine would forego Phase 3 clinical trials that involve tens of thousands of people, a critical component in vaccine development and safety testing.
Farley said he is worried about political motivations at the federal level to debut the vaccine ahead of Election Day.
“All I can say is that I will evaluate the data that's available when and if a vaccine is authorized for use and make the recommendations based upon my assessment and speaking to experts around the country as well,” Farley said."

Some people infected with the novel coronavirus shed fragments of its genetic material in their feces, which can then be detected in wastewater even if they’re asymptomatic. This method can offer health officials an early warning because the virus may show up in sewage days before infected people show symptoms and submit themselves for testing. This monitoring technique has been used by cities and even national parks across the country and the world.
At the University of Arizona (UA), researchers were collecting samples of sewage from 20 buildings on campus as part of the school’s testing regimen as roughly 5,000 students returned to campus for the 2020-2021 academic year, reports Jaclyn Peiser for the Washington Post.
This week, the technique detected coronavirus genetic material in the Likins dorm’s wastewater. On Wednesday the school tested all 311 people associated with the dorm. Those tests revealed two students who were experiencing asymptomatic infections, and UA swiftly quarantined them, per the Post.
“We in fact found cases that no one would have known about and now we’re contact tracing all of their contacts to find out how many other students may be positive and asymptomatic,” says Robert Robbins, the school’s president, in a news briefing.
Testing on campus had turned up 47 positive coronavirus tests as of Thursday morning, reports Christopher Conover for Arizona Public Media.
Other colleges monitoring their wastewater as they attempt to resume instruction in what is sure to be a highly unusual academic year include the University of California at San Diego and Syracuse University, according to the Post.
""Testing the wastewater gives you an idea of the number of cases within a community and if the numbers are increasing or decreasing,"" says Ian Pepper, director of UA’s Water and Energy Sustainable Technology Center which is conducting wastewater surveillance on campus, in a statement. ""The approach can also be used to help determine if an intervention is working to reduce the transmission of the virus.""
UA is also using an exposure notification app called COVID Watch, reports Shaq Davis for Tucson.com. The app, which has roughly 11,000 users, detects nearby devices via bluetooth and will send out a notification to anyone who has come in close contact with someone who later reports themselves as infected.
Other campuses, including Notre Dame, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Michigan State University, have experienced large enough spikes in cases that they were forced to switch to online only classes, according to the Post.
This instance of using wastewater to detect a nascent outbreak before it spread widely shows the promise of this monitoring technique, says Richard Carmona, a former U.S. Surgeon General who is guiding UA’s reopening, in a press conference.
“Nobody would have known that otherwise, but with that early detection, we jumped on it right away, tested those youngsters and got them the appropriate isolation where they needed to be,” says Carmona. “And you think about if we had missed it, if we had waited until they became symptomatic, and they stayed in that dorm for days, or a week or the whole incubation period, how many other people would have been infected?”"

Students weren’t happy, faculty weren’t happy. And so, they started to come up with plans on how to reopen for in-person instruction for the fall semester.

The news comes just four days after the school suspended in-person classes for two weeks following an initial spike of more than 100 cases on campus, which it attributed to off-campus student gatherings.
That figure has since grown to 211 students as of Wednesday afternoon, the last time Temple's Covid-19 dashboard was updated. No employees have tested positive.
The rise in cases, as well as consultations with the Philadelphia Department of Public Health, spurred the school to ""pivot to primarily online education, as we said we would be prepared to do,"" President Richard Englert and Provost JoAnne Epps said in a letter to the campus community Thursday morning.
The students who have tested positive have shown either ""no or mild to moderate"" flu-like symptoms, they said.
Only Temple classes that are essential to be held in-person will be allow to meet, representing just about 5% of the school's overall course offerings.
Students will be allowed to stay in their on-campus residences, the school said, to accommodate those who want to retain access to campus resources or are concerned about returning home to a family member with an underlying health condition. Those that want to leave campus can receive a full refund on their housing and meal plans if they leave by Sunday, Sept. 13.
""For those students already taking a fully online course load, this will not be a major change. On the other hand, we know this is disappointing for the many students and their families who had hoped for an on-campus experience,"" Englert and Epps' message read. ""Please know that if the data supported a decision to safely continue the fall semester experience on campus, we would have made every effort to do so. Unfortunately, the risks associated with the Covid-19 pandemic are simply too great for our students, faculty, staff and neighboring community.""
Temple was the only large university in the city to bring students back to campus for the fall semester, with both Drexel University and the University of Pennsylvania opting to keep dorms closed and hold the majority of classes virtually.
Temple started the fall semester last Monday with fewer than 9,000 students attending classes on campus, compared to about 27,000 on the first day of classes last fall. Temple faculty and staff railed against the school's decision to open for in-person instruction, demanding that administrators move fall semester courses online to prevent the spread of Covid-19.
The spike in cases at Temple has sparked concern among city officials, who sounded the alarm this week about it potentially driving outbreaks in other parts of the city. At a press conference Tuesday, Philadelphia Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas Farley said there was a ""substantial risk"" of the outbreak infecting nearby communities in North Philadelphia since many students live off-campus. The neighborhoods surrounding Temple are largely home to Black and Hispanic populations, who also face a higher risk of hospitalization and death from Covid-19, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."

(THE CONVERSATION) Scientists have learned a few things over the past six months as the COVID-19 pandemic has continued. We’ve learned that the virus that causes COVID-19 transmits particularly well when a group of people are together in a small, poorly ventilated area. We’ve learned that young people are just as susceptible as older people to infection. We’ve learned that if there is widespread community transmission, the virus will find its way to the very places we don’t want it go.
So, it’s not surprising to us, researchers who study diseases that can be prevented by vaccines, that with schools and colleges reopening, the virus is spreading.
These are places designed around the idea of bringing lots of people to one place. Many of them bring people together from all over the world. They are perfect places for disease to spread.
How we got here
Back in March, colleges and universities closed down like everything else except essential businesses. They sent students home. There was a rough transition to online instruction. Students weren’t happy, faculty weren’t happy. And so, they started to come up with plans on how to reopen for in-person instruction for the fall semester.
Many places installed plexi-glass barriers in classrooms, considered mask mandates and worked out physical distancing in lecture halls. Most people realized that professors who taught large classes should plan for remote learning.
University administrators and public health experts started making these plans in the spring. Back then, we scientists and public health researchers all operated under the assumption that community spread would be under some sort of control by fall. We all thought that the country would increase testing capacity, and we have. Then, once new cases dropped to a low level, we could institute contact tracing, the way other countries had.
But that part hasn’t happened. And so now these same colleges and universities are facing huge increases in cases, including at the University of North Carolina, Notre Dame and the University of Alabama. Many universities that have opted to return to in-person classes are also having a surge in cases. These outbreaks will inevitably spread to the wider communities in which the campuses are located.
It seems that for many of these institutions, the priority was on financial concerns, which involved a return to a normal fall semester to the greatest extent possible. They then developed plans that they thought would make this possible. Faculty at manyinstitutions and at least one ethics committee have argued that the priority should have been the safety of students, faculty and the surrounding communities.
While schools across the country have different priorities, enrollments, campus size, and student demographics, many schools share one thing in common: making no real contingency plans around reopening amid COVID-19, other than going remote if governors mandated it.
The schools that did spend the summer figuring out how to deliver high quality education remotely, or how to safely provide housing and access to services for the most vulnerable students, are less likely to have their fall semester disrupted. However, the College Crisis Initiative’s data dashboard found that only 7% of 1,442 four-year schools surveyed were planning on a fully online fall semester.
The challenge ahead
And so, the inevitable has come to pass. Now, many college campuses will struggle to control their outbreaks, because there are a lot of unique challenges inherent to COVID-19 in this population.
Colleges are not nursing homes or prisons. Some are trying to limit contact with the broader community.
But in general, students are not kept under lock and key. They have visitors from other schools. They go back and forth to their parents’ homes. And, yes, they go to parties. To us, blaming students for wanting a normal-ish college experience when the schools themselves have set the tone for trying hard to return to normal isn’t fair.
It’s also true that not all of the contact students have is as irresponsible as some have suggested. Many students hold jobs in the communities that surround the school. And most of these jobs aren’t typically the work-from-home type of job. In our undergraduate careers we both worked at jobs that had high contact rates with the community. And often, when your job is waiting tables at a local pizza place or manning a library desk, most of your colleagues are students as well. All of these factors will make contact tracing very hard.
Public health experts also expect a relatively high proportion of college-aged students to be either completely asymptomatic or to only have very mild symptoms. Without universal testing, these students won’t know they’re sick. They may not isolate if they have mild symptoms. But they will still be able to spread the virus to others. Symptom and temperature screenings may not recognize these individuals as those who need to stay away from campus buildings.
A different kind of campus test
Which brings us to testing. Some places are doing universal testing of students, multiple times per week. But, given the state of testing in the U.S., that is not a realistic possibility for most schools.
Let’s look at our university as an example. The University of Michigan has an undergraduate population of 30,000 students. Let’s assume that two-thirds of them came back to campus. That means 40,000 tests per week just for University of Michigan undergraduate students. Right now the entire state of Michigan is doing a little more than 200,000 diagnostic tests per week. Someschools have developed their own tests to handle this huge increase in capacity. But many university labs are involved in testing for large health systems and the rest of the state too. In these places it becomes very difficult for 1 in 5 tests available in an entire state to be dedicated to the students at a single university.
A scale-up of rapid, at-home antigen tests could be one approach to make testing on this scale feasible. These types of tests have the advantage of detecting highly infectious individuals – making them a good screening tool – but many are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration because they aren’t as sensitive as the standard PCR-based diagnostic test.
[The Conversation’s science, health and technology editors pick their favorite stories. Weekly on Wednesdays.]
If transmission on campus continues to happen mostly outside of the classroom, simply going remote will not solve the problem. Keeping students on campus will be risky. Many students will be attempting to navigate social distancing guidelines without a traditional social support network.
As much as possible, we believe students need to be able to safely return to their homes. But this can’t be done haphazardly. Bringing them to campus was a predictable risk – so is sending them home. As colleges inevitably move back to online instruction, plans must be put in place to minimize the risk of seeding epidemics. Dismissing all students, some of whom are infectious, back to their home communities risks spreading the virus further across the country, a bad outcome for all.
The unique epidemiology of COVID-19 in young adults, along with the contact patterns on college campuses and the inability to effectively screen through symptom reports or diagnostic testing, have left college campuses with few options for safely operating with in-person classes. We know that few wanted an all-remote fall semester, but it’s becoming clear that was probably our best bet.

All students living in the Garrigus Suites on the Storrs campus have been asked to quarantine after nine of the school’s 10 new cases on Thursday were from that dorm, the school said in a statement. While students who have tested positive were moved to COVID-19 isolation beds reserved on campus, the rest of the students have been quarantined in their dorm.
“The quarantine will need to continue until a clear decrease in transmission can be documented through serial testing,” the statement said. “All residents in Garrigus will be tested twice a week, and there is an adjacent dining hall that will be open only to Garrigus residents during this quarantine period.”
A total of 62 UConn students — 52 living on campus and 10 commuters — have tested positive for COVID-19. There were 42 residential students who were recovering in isolation beds on campus as of Thursday, according to the school’s online database. The other 20 students have either recovered or are living off campus.
A total of 5,968 tests have been conducted of UConn students living on the Storrs campus, the school said. There have been no cases among UConn-Stamford residential students, but two commuters to that campus have tested positive.
The students who are quarantined cannot attend classes when they start on Monday, the school said. The school said it will accommodate those students to work remotely.
Last week, UConn — the first NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision program to cancel its season — ceased football activities following positive tests from six of its players.
Connecticut medical professionals have said they expect college cases to rise as students return to campus. However, the state Department of Public Health is not keeping track of those cases by campus, according to Lora Rae Anderson, communications director for the state’s chief operating officer.
Earlier this month, several UConn students were removed from on-campus housing as the school investigated an “unapproved gathering” that did not meet social distancing and mask-wearing guidelines, university officials said.
Since UConn students have returned to campus this month, there have been reports on social media about gatherings that could violate COVID-19 safety measures established by the state and school. One video posted on Snapchat showed a mask-less gathering in a crowded room.
UConn’s COVID-19 policy requires all students to wear masks when not in a car or their residence, and the state’s COVID-19 rules limit indoor gatherings to 25 people and outside gatherings to 100.
At colleges and universities across the state, penalties for throwing parties during the pandemic can be strict — sometimes leading to suspensions and expulsion.

Indiana University is the most recent school observing COVID-19 outbreaks among its student body.
Officials blame Greek life and other communal housing.
Indiana University (IU) at Bloomington officials are asking students to seriously evaluate whether they want to continue living in communal housing environments as more COVID-19 infections are emerging among the student body, particularly within the school’s Greek system.
The school announced that positivity testing rates in certain Greek and communal student homes are now above 50 percent in what school public health experts are calling an “uncontrolled spread of COVID-19.”
About 2,600 Indiana University students live within Greek housing or other communal situations. Given the highly communicable nature of the virus, which travels mainly through aerosol particles, it renders the other 42,000 students at risk, as well as the 12,000 faculty and staff that work on the campus.
CAN I SHOP FOR GROCERIES SAFELY DURING THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC?
“Due to the nature of communal living (Greek housing), in which there is a high density of residents, shared bathrooms, and a number of common living, sleeping and dining spaces, viruses like COVID-19 easily spread,” the school wrote. “Greek houses at IU Bloomington are seeing this type of spread at quickly increasing rates.”
The Greek homes are owned and operated by the individual Greek systems, which means that they are privately owned and out of IU’s jurisdiction to shut down or close. The school noted that Greek organizations were ordered to develop plans to mitigate the spread of the virus upon students returning to campus, and stated that most of those plans “are proving to be ineffective” in preventing transmission.
The school also released a chart outlining which fraternities and sororities are currently under quarantine and how many cases have been reported so far.
“IU expects national Greek organizations and housing corporations to work directly with their students and families to make decisions in their best interest about their living environment and safely find alternate arrangements as needed,” the school said.
Colleges and universities nationwide have struggled to decide whether to reopen amid the pandemic, weighing the risk of an outbreak among vulnerable staff and students versus the fallout — both economically and for students — of not having students return to campus.
For schools that have opted to reopen, the experiment appears to be going poorly; the Universities of Iowa, South Carolina and Alabama all attempted reopenings but have since reported nearly a thousand cases of coronavirus each.
In response to emerging outbreaks on college campuses, Deborah Birx of the White House Coronavirus Task Force urged state governors to not send students home if they are diagnosed to prevent further virus spread. Instead, schools should have quarantine housing and medical support to help sick students recover."

Ravina Kullar, epidemiologist and spokesperson for Infectious Diseases Society of America, says sending students home risks exposing other people, reports Bloomberg.
“There’s just inevitably going to be an outbreak,” she continued. “Colleges need to take on the burden of having these students kept at their campus and taking care of them.”
Earlier last month, U.S. President Donald Trump urged colleges to reopen and said sending students home could put relatives at risk.
“Instead of saving lives, a decision to close universities could cost lives,” he said.
The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill was one of the first to send students home to finish the semester remotely after an outbreak. Townson University (Md.) and East Carolina University (N.C.) did the same.
At Notre Dame University, cases increased to 147 less than two weeks after the first person was diagnosed. Instead of clearing the campus, President John Jenkins consulted with the county’s deputy health officer and decided to make classes remote but keep students on campus while cracking down on interactions between those living on and off-campus.
The Indiana school ramped up testing, added more isolation beds, and expanded contact tracing, ultimately slowing cases from spreading to surrounding communities.

Contact Tracing Nearly Impossible When Students Sent Home
The biggest issue with sending students home is the ability to contact trace, especially for out-of-state students. If students live nearby, tracers can do their job, said Howard Koh, former assistant secretary for health for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. If they leave the state to go home, it is less effective.
“That will make the job very difficult, if not impossible,” he said.
According to Bloomberg, the U.S. has struggled with contact tracing for several reasons, including getting people to answer phone calls from public health officials and respond truthfully. It is even more difficult at colleges and universities where students are being disciplined for violating rules. For instance, an outbreak at SUNY Oneonta led to the suspension of five students and three campus organizations.
Students are also excited to be back at school with their peers, leading many to break rules put forth by schools on social gatherings.
“The more contacts a person has, the harder contact tracing can be,” said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. “People may not even know who they’re in contact with, especially if they are drinking.”"

A consensus is building among public health experts that it's better to keep university students on campus after a COVID-19 outbreak rather than send them home as many are doing.
It's easier to isolate sick or exposed students and trace their contacts if they stay put, said Ravina Kullar, epidemiologist and spokesperson for Infectious Diseases Society of America. Sending students home risks exposing other people there as well as along the way, and makes contact tracing all but impossible.
""There's just inevitably going to be an outbreak,"" she said. ""Colleges need to take on the burden of having these students kept at their campus and taking care of them.""
The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill was one of the first to reverse in-person learning, sending students home to complete the semester remotely after the school had an outbreak. Colleges including Towson University and East Carolina University have done the same.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Aug. 27 that schools in the state would switch to online learning for two weeks if they record 100 cases or 5% of the population gets infected, keeping students in place while tamping the virus's spread. The University of Notre Dame adopted the same strategy, and announced Friday that it will resume in-person classes on Sept. 2.
U.S. President Donald Trump spoke of the risk this month while urging campuses to reopen, saying that sending students home after an outbreak could put relatives at risk. ""Instead of saving lives, a decision to close universities could cost lives,"" he said.
Notre Dame President John Jenkins had initially leaned toward clearing the campus when cases shot up to 147 less than two weeks after the first person was diagnosed. The county's deputy health officer, Mark Fox, persuaded him to make classes remote and clamp down on interactions first to see if that could slow the spread.
Notre Dame had a solid plan for reopening its campus, Fox said. The challenge was the magnitude and the velocity of cases, he said. When it hit, the school ramped up testing, added more isolation beds and expanded contact tracing. Together with tight restrictions on interactions between those living on and off campus, Notre Dame slowed cases from jumping to communities surrounding the school.
If students live relatively nearby or are in-state, tracers can do their job, said Howard Koh, former assistant secretary for health for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health professor. If students leave the state to go home, it's less effective.
""That will make the job very difficult, if not impossible,"" he said.
Contact tracing can help manage outbreaks when done correctly. The U.S. has struggled with it for many reasons, including getting people to answer the phone and respond truthfully. That's even harder at college, when students worry about being disciplined for violating rules: Many schools have limited parties and other gatherings to reduce COVID-19 risks. Young people also relish finally being back with their friends.
""The more contacts a person has, the harder contact tracing can be,"" said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. ""People may not even know who they're in contact with, especially if they are drinking.""
Effective programs interview a patient as soon as possible after a diagnosis to find out where they went while contagious, then contact anyone they encountered about their possible exposure. It's usually recommended those contacts quarantine and monitor for symptoms.
In Chapel Hill, sick Tar Heels were isolated, and UNC quarantined anyone who was exposed when it announced it was sending students home on Aug. 17.
Those who went home were advised to self-isolate for 14 days, according to Ken Pittman, campus health executive director. Contact tracers have been effective in mitigating further spread, he said. Still, the UNC COVID-19 dashboard showed another 26 new cases on Aug. 28.
East Carolina reported 370 total positive cases from students as of Aug. 24. ECU's contact tracing coordinator, Kelli Russell, said although they've run into issues with voice mailboxes that are full or not set up, students are answering their phones and speaking with the trained contact tracers, and have been transparent about where they have been and whom they have been in contact with.
UNC's staff and student health services work with county officials to locate cases on campus or nearby and traces close contacts of students testing positive even if they've left campus, Pittman said. They'll coordinate with local health departments when a close contact who isn't a student is identified, even out of state."

The university and Philadelphia Health Department conducted hundreds of tests Monday and are advising students to take precautions.
This has been happening to universities across the country. They open and there’s a spike in coronavirus cases, forcing a shutdown.
Temple University announced Sunday it will temporarily stop in-person classes and Monday there were 400 appointments for tests. But they were bombarded with an unexpected number of students who showed up worried about being infected.
There was a long line of students at Temple University in North Philadelphia waiting for COVID-19 testing after the university paused in-person classes because of a spike in cases, doubling from 50 on Friday to 100 by Sunday.
“We are doing large-scale testing of those students who have been close contacts and those students who’ve called and said I’m not feeling well,” said Temple representative Ray Betzner.
Twenty-five percent of Temple’s students — about 9,000 — chose in-person classes. The hybrid model allowed for both on-campus or remote learning.
The fall semester was only a week old when the coronavirus cases on campus spiked.
“We were both a little surprised to see the numbers jump so much but what are you going to do? It’s college,” freshman Kylie Hier.
“It’s bound to happen that cases go up. It’s a big school, it happens,” freshman Taylor Woolford said.
Contact tracing indicates the students who tested positive live in dorms and off-campus housing. The outbreak does not appear to be related to large parties.
“There is some reason to believe that smaller social gatherings, six to eight people, getting together, pizza, beer, watch a game, for example, may be where this uptick in cases is coming from,” Betzner said.
Students who test positive are being advised to self-isolate for two weeks.
The Philadelphia Health Department is providing additional on-campus testing and helping with contact tracing.
“Some cases have reported that they may have attended classes when they were ill and so we prioritize the students that we know were close contacts to those cases,” Dr. Angelico Razon said.
Temple University is now switching to all remote learning for at least two weeks.
“I’m okay with it, it keeps everybody safe. You gotta do what you gotta do,” freshman Manbeer Grewal said.
Health officials are warning students to avoid social gatherings with people outside of their household and to wear masks.
As of Sunday, the university had tested more than 5,000 students and 103 were positive.
They’ll be testing throughout the week and are expecting to get results within 48 hours.
The health department says they hope to have a better understanding of the outbreak and its local impact within the next few days."

A COVID-19 outbreak around Temple University's campus in North Philadelphia has the city's health department worried that students living off-campus may transmit the coronavirus to the surrounding community.
Temple has reported 127 COVID-19 cases since students returned late last month. To curb the spread of the virus, the university paused in-person instruction for a two-week period.
While the majority of active cases at Temple are classified as ""on-campus,"" that does not necessarily mean those with the infection live on campus. It means that they were in a Temple facility at some point during the time they were infectious.
The city's health department has been actively involved in expanding testing both on-campus and around the university, Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas Farley said Tuesday.
On Sunday, the city conducted tests at an off-campus residential building where there were already three known cases of COVID-19. Among the 38 people tested at that building, 15 had positive results.
Yesterday, the health department tested 396 people on campus. Among them, 60 came back positive — about 15%.
""Overall, these numbers are concerning, and the rate of rise is even more concerning,"" Farley said. ""There clearly is an outbreak occurring among Temple University students.""
Contact tracing efforts conducted by the city suggest most of the exposure is occurring among students living in off-campus apartments, many of them in shared spaces.
Temple President Richard Englert said over the weekend that most of the university's cases are asymptomatic or mild infections. But city officials are concerned about the virus affecting vulnerable residents in North Philadelphia and beyond.
To manage the outbreak, the health department has updated its guidelines on social gatherings at colleges and universities in Philadelphia. The guidance now clarifies that gatherings of 25 or fewer people should not be considered safe, as some may have assumed based on the city's general limits on gatherings.
""You should assume that anyone around you is infected,"" Farley said Tuesday, addressing Temple students. ""Stay in your room or stay in your apartment unless you have to go out for essential errands. Wear a mask when you're around anyone else. Otherwise, this outbreak could grow quickly, and it could threaten the rest of the campus and the rest of the city.""
The health department is now working closely with Temple's administration to develop a longer-term plan for addressing the outbreak as the semester continues.
Philadelphia reported 131 new COVID-19 cases Tuesday, bringing the city's total to 33,909 since the start of the pandemic. Another two fatalities brought the city's death toll to 1,751, including 875 nursing home residents.
During the week ending Aug. 29, the city averaged 97 cases per day, with a test positivity rate of about 3.7%.
Farley noted that the newly reported cases do not include many Temple students who list their home addresses outside Philadelphia. Those cases will be added to the city's count as the university provides up-to-date information, including names and phone numbers of students for the health department to conduct contact tracing.
Still, among the new cases reported in Philadelphia on Tuesday, 32% were between the ages of 20 and 29.
""I think that large percentage does reflect the outbreak that's occurring at Temple,"" Farley said. “The number of new cases that we’re seeing on Temple’s campus is extremely worrisome.""
The outbreak mirrors similar issues with COVID-19 at college campuses across the region and the United States.
Lock Haven University in Clinton County suspended in-person courses for two weeks on Tuesday in response to increased infections. Last week, Bloomsburg University in Columbia County reverted to online classes.
""We do know there have been problems with colleges around the country,"" Farley said. ""We also know there are colleges that have not had problems around the country. We are in touch with the other colleges that have in-person classes in the city, and we're asking them again to look over their safety procedures.
""We're hopeful that some other colleges may be able to maintain it safely, but we're going to be very closely in touch with this and see if that's possible.""
As the city moves to lift restrictions on indoor dining and theaters across Philadelphia next week, the health commissioner warned that the situation at Temple poses an additional threat of community spread.
""I'd say there's a substantial risk of that because many of these students are living off-campus,"" Farley said. ""They're living in neighborhoods."""

A coronavirus outbreak among a group of students has forced Temple University to implement a 14-day ""pause"" on in-person classes.
Starting on Monday, any class that doesn't require in-person instruction will conduct all-remote learning through at least Friday, Sept. 11, Temple President Richard Englert said.
Classes that are already online will not be impacted, and only classes that have been deemed essential will still be held in-person during the next two weeks.
The school reported 103 active cases of COVID-19 among students on Sunday after conducting more than 5,000 tests over the last two weeks. While most who have tested positive are asymptomatic, some are experiencing mild flu-like symptoms.
Englert said Temple officials believe this outbreak of coronavirus cases stems from small, off-campus social gatherings. As a result, the Philadelphia Department of Public Health was forced to revise its guidance regarding social gatherings among the city's college students this past weekend.
No more than 25 people should hang out at indoor gatherings, and no more than 50 people should get together outdoors. Events where students are not wearing face masks or practicing social distancing should not be taking place.
As a result of the recent outbreak, the university is urging students to wear face coverings on and off campus, avoid social gatherings of any size, and cancel any travel plans.
The university also is collaborating with city health officials to test and contact trace cases. Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms should be tested, and anyone who came in contact with someone who tested positive for the virus should self-quarantine for two weeks.
Temple remains hopeful it will be able to return to its hybrid learning model for the fall semester, but any decision to move forward will be driven by public health data and guidance.
""Since the very first reports of COVID-19 touched our lives, Temple has consistently held one position: We will do the best we can to keep our community healthy and safe, while ensuring our students receive an excellent education and continue progress to graduation,"" Temple University President Richard Englert said.
""I want to thank all of our students, faculty and administrative staff members for your cooperation so far. We are counting on your continued diligence as we meet the challenges ahead. Rest assured that we will continue to base our decisions on data and the advice of medical and health professionals. We are in this together, so we can be together.""
Dining and residence halls will remain open, and student support services will continue operations too.
Temple's decision to revert to virtual learning for the next two weeks comes just a week after the fall semester began.
The Temple Association of University Professionals, the school's faculty union, said that two weeks of online-only instruction is not enough. The group has been among several on campus calling for an all-remote education model this semester.
""We need to do everything possible to keep people from falling ill with this terrible virus,"" the organization wrote on Facebook.
Temple Student Government has called for online-only classes for the entire fall term and all residence halls to close. The organization did not immediately respond for comment on Monday morning."

After social gatherings led to 71 students at SUNY Oneonta testing positive for COVID-19, Governor Andrew Cuomo said Sunday that it was a warning to K-12 schools eyeing reopening in the coming days, particularly in the western part of the state.
On Sunday, incoming SUNY Chancellor James Malatras said several students at the university had been suspended for throwing parties against school guidelines and containment measures were still underway. Cuomo called the situation the “canary in coal mine” for whether – or how – in-person learning can take place once again.
“I think what we’re seeing in colleges, we’re going to see in the K-12 setting when those schools start to reopen,” Cuomo said. “They have to have the right plan in place, look at the colleges for what’s going on… A plan on paper is one thing, being able to do it is a second question that has to be asked, and my advice to the K-12 is the same: Err on the side of caution.”
The Sunday announcement comes a day after the United Federation of Teachers in New York City prepared to vote on a strike if there is not a better plan to protect the health of educators ahead of the Sept. 10 start of the new year. They are asking the city for better ventilation, uniform mask requirements in schools, and greater testing capacity.
Asked about the turmoil, Cuomo said that the power should be in the teachers’ hands to decide whether or not measures from their respective school districts (including the city’s Department of Education, which counts as one district for all New York City) are adequate.
“The local school districts don’t need me to say in New York City when the children should wear a mask or in Buffalo or Long Island. A local school district can decide on a mask policy specific to that application and we’ve left some flexibility [in the statewide mask mandate] for local application,” Cuomo said. “The teachers need to feel safe otherwise they won’t be going back to school. I’ve said that from day one. We have all these bureaucratic discussions… No, this is about parents and teachers, those are the only decision-makers here.”
State Health Commissioner Howard Zucker said masks are recommended at all times, including instruction and activity, as well as socially distanced classrooms and other school settings.
With flu season about to cast a shadow on New York’s door, all respiratory deaths need to be confirmed for COVID-19 or the flu to strengthen data, according to Zucker. Cuomo said that strengthened data will also further clarify the COVID-19 death rate."

We’ve learned that the virus that causes COVID-19 transmits particularly well when a group of people are together in a small, poorly ventilated area. We’ve learned that young people are just as susceptible as older people to infection. We’ve learned that if there is widespread community transmission, the virus will find its way to the very places we don’t want it go.
So, it’s not surprising to us, researchers who study diseases that can be prevented by vaccines, that with schools and colleges reopening, the virus is spreading.
These are places designed around the idea of bringing lots of people to one place. Many of them bring people together from all over the world. They are perfect places for disease to spread.
Back in March, colleges and universities closed down like everything else except essential businesses. They sent students home. There was a rough transition to online instruction. Students weren’t happy, faculty weren’t happy. And so, they started to come up with plans on how to reopen for in-person instruction for the fall semester.
Many places installed plexi-glass barriers in classrooms, considered mask mandates and worked out physical distancing in lecture halls. Most people realized that professors who taught large classes should plan for remote learning.
University administrators and public health experts started making these plans in the spring. Back then, we scientists and public health researchers all operated under the assumption that community spread would be under some sort of control by fall. We all thought that the country would increase testing capacity, and we have. Then, once new cases dropped to a low level, we could institute contact tracing, the way other countries had.
But that part hasn’t happened. And so now these same colleges and universities are facing huge increases in cases, including at the University of North Carolina, Notre Dame and the University of Alabama. Many universities that have opted to return to in-person classes are also having a surge in cases. These outbreaks will inevitably spread to the wider communities in which the campuses are located.
It seems that for many of these institutions, the priority was on financial concerns, which involved a return to a normal fall semester to the greatest extent possible. They then developed plans that they thought would make this possible. Faculty at many institutions and at least one ethics committee have argued that the priority should have been the safety of students, faculty and the surrounding communities.
While schools across the country have different priorities, enrollments, campus size, and student demographics, many schools share one thing in common: making no real contingency plans around reopening amid COVID-19, other than going remote if governors mandated it.
The schools that did spend the summer figuring out how to deliver high quality education remotely, or how to safely provide housing and access to services for the most vulnerable students, are less likely to have their fall semester disrupted. However, the College Crisis Initiative’s data dashboard found that only 7% of 1,442 four-year schools surveyed were planning on a fully online fall semester.
And so, the inevitable has come to pass. Now, many college campuses will struggle to control their outbreaks, because there are a lot of unique challenges inherent to COVID-19 in this population.
Colleges are not nursing homes or prisons. Some are trying to limit contact with the broader community.
But in general, students are not kept under lock and key. They have visitors from other schools. They go back and forth to their parents’ homes. And, yes, they go to parties. To us, blaming students for wanting a normal-ish college experience when the schools themselves have set the tone for trying hard to return to normal isn’t fair.
It’s also true that not all of the contact students have is as irresponsible as some have suggested. Many students hold jobs in the communities that surround the school. And most of these jobs aren’t typically the work-from-home type of job. In our undergraduate careers we both worked at jobs that had high contact rates with the community. And often, when your job is waiting tables at a local pizza place or manning a library desk, most of your colleagues are students as well. All of these factors will make contact tracing very hard.
Public health experts also expect a relatively high proportion of college-aged students to be either completely asymptomatic or to only have very mild symptoms. Without universal testing, these students won’t know they’re sick. They may not isolate if they have mild symptoms. But they will still be able to spread the virus to others. Symptom and temperature screenings may not recognize these individuals as those who need to stay away from campus buildings.
Which brings us to testing. Some places are doing universal testing of students, multiple times per week. But, given the state of testing in the U.S., that is not a realistic possibility for most schools.
Let’s look at our university as an example. The University of Michigan has an undergraduate population of 30,000 students. Let’s assume that two-thirds of them came back to campus. That means 40,000 tests per week just for University of Michigan undergraduate students. Right now the entire state of Michigan is doing a little more than 200,000 diagnostic tests per week. Someschools have developed their own tests to handle this huge increase in capacity. But many university labs are involved in testing for large health systems and the rest of the state too. In these places it becomes very difficult for 1 in 5 tests available in an entire state to be dedicated to the students at a single university.
A scale-up of rapid, at-home antigen tests could be one approach to make testing on this scale feasible. These types of tests have the advantage of detecting highly infectious individuals – making them a good screening tool – but many are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration because they aren’t as sensitive as the standard PCR-based diagnostic test.
If transmission on campus continues to happen mostly outside of the classroom, simply going remote will not solve the problem. Keeping students on campus will be risky. Many students will be attempting to navigate social distancing guidelines without a traditional social support network.
As much as possible, we believe students need to be able to safely return to their homes. But this can’t be done haphazardly. Bringing them to campus was a predictable risk – so is sending them home. As colleges inevitably move back to online instruction, plans must be put in place to minimize the risk of seeding epidemics. Dismissing all students, some of whom are infectious, back to their home communities risks spreading the virus further across the country, a bad outcome for all.
The unique epidemiology of COVID-19 in young adults, along with the contact patterns on college campuses and the inability to effectively screen through symptom reports or diagnostic testing, have left college campuses with few options for safely operating with in-person classes. We know that few wanted an all-remote fall semester, but it’s becoming clear that was probably our best bet."

Some two weeks after the start of the fall semester, Temple reported more than 200 novel coronavirus cases. The Philadelphia Department of Health set up a mass testing site on the school's North Philadelphia campus.
The spike caused the university to pause in-person learning for two weeks, but by Thursday they decided to extend that ban for the rest of the semester.
""Now, in light of the recent increase in positive test results among our students, and after consultation with our own healthcare professionals and leaders at the Philadelphia Department of Public Health, we have concluded that the data indicate it is time to pivot to primarily online education, as we said we would be prepared to do,"" Temple University president Richard Englert said in a statement Thursday morning.
Essential in-person classes will continue. The university estimates 95% of classes will be delivered online.
Students living in on-campus housing can get a full refund of housing and meal plans for the fall semester if they leave by Sunday, Sept. 13, Englert said. Students who need to access university services like computer labs or health services as well as those who have family members with underlying health conditions can stay on campus.
Temple is one of several major universities around the United States contending with major COVID-19 outbreaks. There have been large outbreaks at Iowa State, the University of Iowa, James Madison University and the University of Notre Dame.
Speaking to NBC News on Wednesday, Dr. Anthony Fauci urged schools to keep infected students and those exposed quarantined on campus instead of sending them home.
""When you send them home, particularly when you're dealing with a university where people come from multiple different locations, you could be seeding the different places with infection,"" said Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
The Black Doctors COVID-19 Consortium, a group focused on testing vulnerable populations that lack adequate access to quality health care, diverted their testing program to Temple to help the city get a scope of the outbreak on campus.
""We were scheduled to be at a church in Darby, Pennsylvania yesterday that we had scheduled with Congresswoman [Mary Kay] Scanlon that we had to cancel, but we recognize that the positivity rate on this campus is extremely high,"" Dr. Ala Stanford of the consortium said Wednesday. ""And they’re in the heart of North Philadelphia.""
University and city health officials have said they believe small, off-campus social gatherings were fueling the Temple outbreak.
This is a developing story. Check back for updates."

Now nearly 10 percent of the student population is infected with COVID-19 and the University of Dayton is dealing with the worst campus outbreak in Ohio and one of the worst outbreaks of any university in the Midwest.
The number of COVID-19 infections at UD grew to 801 on Tuesday with 70 more daily cases reported, according to the latest data from the school. The university remains on Level 4 out of 5 on its COVID-19 Status System and Public Health Dayton and Montgomery County are involved, working to help the university deal with the outbreak.
“The outbreak of COVID-19 on campus was traced to several clusters of the virus that emerged among networks of students based on several small gatherings that occurred prior to the start of classes,” UD officials told WDTN.com in a statement on Wednesday. “(The gatherings) did not comply fully with the university’s safety protocols.”
As universities begin on-site classes for the first time since COVID-19 shut down much of the country during the spring, outbreaks have occurred on campuses across the country. Miami University nearly doubled its numbers in one day after recent testing showed 529 positive cases. The University of Iowa, which has one of the worst outbreaks in the country, had its number of positives grow to 1,142 as of testing through Aug. 31.
Even if gatherings are small, they can still lead to a large congregate outbreak, according to Dan Suffletto of Public Health Dayton and Montgomery County. Dorm rooms are small, apartments often house many students at a time, and people living within close proximity will be susceptible to contact the virus.
“It’s similar to how it progresses in a nursing home,” Dan Suffoletto of Public Health Dayton and Montgomery County said. “You have a lot of people living together and it’s going to spread.”
Some students going home because of outbreak
UD said students identified as close contacts of someone with COVID-19 needed to return home to their permanent residence if they lived within 400 miles of the campus. The idea is to allow more isolation and quarantine space for students who live outside that 400-mile range or have family members who are at high risk for the virus. If they can’t return home, they are transferred to quarantine housing that’s provided on campus.
“For students who need to isolate, returning home allows them to be under the care of their families and doctors,” the university stated.
UD said its been encouraged by the response of the student body. In its statement, UD said students are following safety protocols more stringently now than before classes started and said they are witnessing more peer-to-peer encouragement. Given the incubation period of the virus, UD stated it expected it to take several weeks before positive cases start dropping in numbers.
“It will take some time, however, for this positive change in behavior to be reflected in the testing data,” the university’s statement said.

Furman University announced Thursday mandatory COVID-19 testing will be conducted for all students Friday.
The school made the announcement in a letter to students that was posted on its website.
Students were to be assigned times to show up for testing at Timmons Arena.
The letter said the school will test all on-campus students, including approved commuters, and will require returning second and third-year students to provide a negative test result before arriving on campus.
The school said it was modifying testing protocols in part because of concerns over the recent outbreak related to off-campus activities.
The university announced Wednesday it suspended one of its Kappa Alpha fraternity after it hosted unauthorized parties that resulted in the spread of COVID-19.
Of the 59 people who came forward to report the parties, nearly 60% tested positive for COVID-19, officials said.
Furman University suspends fraternity after parties spread COVID-19 to guests, officials say
Second and third-year students were returned to campus this week, which is cited as another reason for the mandatory testing.
Their return ""will increase campus density and bring together two populations that have been living in different environments,"" the letter said.
The testing will provide more complete data so the school can continue to adjust plans based on the best information available, officials said.
The university asked students to limit and track the people they come in contact with while awaiting the test results, which will be available in 2-3 days.
Students will be provided with instructions and a log to track any close contacts.
""During this low-contact period, we urge you to stay on campus while continuing to follow all of the health and safety guidelines of the Paladin Promise,"" the letter said. ""If you go home this weekend, you should not return to campus until you have received your test result. We encourage you to take advantage of the outdoor spaces, keeping in mind the importance of maintaining 6 feet and masking.""
Meals will be available in the dining hall and Pala-Den during normal times, but students will not be able to eat inside those facilities, starting with lunch on Friday, to help limit personal contact.
The Milford Mall food tent will also be open for lunch and dinner over the weekend.
""We really appreciate your patience and understanding as we continue to do everything we can to protect your health and safety,"" the letter said."

In this week's modeling data, the number of repopulating college towns that have heightened risk for widespread community transmission far outnumber the few campuses that appear to be conferring no new risk to their communities. This is especially notable in regions that reported high case counts before students arrived again, such as the South and Midwest, where the reopening of colleges and some K-12 schools has quickly accelerated the risk for widespread transmission and increasing test positivity rates in the coming weeks. The increasing risk is particularly of concern for smaller college towns—such as Morgantown, W.Va., State College, Pa., and Bloomington, Ind.—that have already seen campus outbreaks. Furthermore, more than two weeks into the new semester, test positivity rates remain over 10% in Iowa City, Tuscaloosa, Ala., and Boone, Mo.
The researchers are watching very closely for impacts across Minnesota, which is seeing some of the highest risk in the PolicyLab model, as the state forges ahead with reopening K-12 schools and colleges simultaneously, while being located in a part of the country that sees some of the earliest arrival of colder weather. Finally, data validity concerns in Mississippi and Texas, and growing risk for virus resurgence in parts of Tennessee, South Carolina, and North Carolina, are reasons to closely monitor forecasts in the South over the next few weeks."

(NEW YORK) -- As colleges deal with COVID-19 outbreaks, some are having their students leave campus -- which medical authorities warn is the opposite of what they should be doing.
White House coronavirus response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx over the weekend advised against residential students -- infected with COVID-19 -- isolating off campus.
""Please isolate at your college,"" Birx said at a news conference. ""Do not return home if you're positive and spread the virus to your family, your aunts, your uncles, your grandparents.""
Birx repeated her warning in a weekly White House call with governors on Tuesday.
""It's really important that you check in with your university presidents to make sure they also have an isolation and care plan for students who become positive, even if they have moved to online,"" Birx said in audio obtained by ABC News.
""It's really important that these students are continuously tested, isolated and cared for and don't return to their multi-generational households where they could dramatically increase spread, particularly over the Labor Day weekend,"" she continued.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, also weighed in this week. On NBC's Today show Wednesday morning, he didn't mince words when he said sending students home after an outbreak is the ""worst thing you could do.""
""Keep them at the university in a place that's sequestered enough from the other students, but don't have them go home because they could be spreading it in their home state,"" he said.
In communications with students, though, some schools are recommending that students go home to isolate or quarantine.
In materials sent to students who are required to quarantine for 14 days, the University of Mississippi encouraged students ""to consult with your family to consider your options for quarantine, including returning to your family residence."" It also advised students that options for isolation ""involve temporary relocation to your family home or a designated isolation space on campus.""
""We know that returning home is not advisable for some students if they have a relative who is in a vulnerable group, while others prefer to go home if their situation allows for it,"" university spokesman Rod Guajardo told ABC News.
The University of Mississippi has had nearly 350 confirmed cases of COVID-19 among students and employees on its Oxford campus since mid-August, when students began to move into the dorms. Currently, there are 295 active cases -- all but nine among students -- and 16 active outbreaks are in campus housing, according to data posted on the school's website. Only 29 students with confirmed cases of COVID-19 are currently in designated isolation spaces.
Some schools have pivoted to virtual learning amid rising cases on campus. Last month, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill ended in-person undergraduate classes after reporting 130 new cases in students in a week. To further help de-densify the campus, undergraduate students living in campus housing could change their residential plans with no penalty.
This week, James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia, became one of the latest schools to go virtual. President Jonathan Alger announced on Tuesday that learning will be primarily online through at least the end of the month due to a ""rapid increase in the number of positive cases."" Since classes started on Aug. 24, JMU has had more than 600 confirmed cases, with a positivity rate of almost 17%, according to data on the school's website. The school will consider a potential return to in-person learning as early as Oct. 5, later this month.
Students were asked to return home by Sept. 7, ""in an effort to reduce the number of people on campus,"" Alger said. Caitlyn Read, a university spokesperson, told ABC News the university is not sending students home who have COVID-19 and are in isolation, or those who have been in contact with a confirmed case and are quarantining, until they finish their prescribed time.
""We are also recommending that all students quarantine for 14 days when they return home to help reduce the likelihood of viral spread to new communities,"" Read said.
JMU students have been encouraged to isolate or quarantine off campus. On its website, the school stated that ""students that live both on and off campus are being asked to return home, to their families, if possible to isolate and/or quarantine."" The school currently has 601 active COVID-19 cases, with 89 students in isolation or quarantine beds on campus.
Space may be at a premium for schools isolating or quarantining students. One reason for going remote, Alger said, is the worry that space may run out. With 143 isolation and quarantine beds total, there were 54 available as of Wednesday. In addition to monitoring health trends over the next four weeks, the university will be looking into acquiring additional capacity should they need it in the future, Read said.
The University of Mississippi also is exploring acquiring more space for isolating and quarantining students, including local hotels and apartment complexes off campus. Its current isolation capacity is at nearly 75%.
""The numbers are fluctuating up and down every day, so our goal is to track and analyze the data available to us and then make decisions to help our students however we can,"" Guajardo said.
The difficulties that come with isolating and quarantining students -- especially those from states on New York's quarantine travel list -- led to Columbia University's decision to go virtual this fall.
In a letter to students last month, President Lee C. Bollinger noted that ""while I have no doubt that we could ensure a safe quarantine period from a public health standpoint, two weeks is a long time to endure isolation, especially for students who will be leaving home for the first time.""
""Conditions for all students in quarantine will be austere, to say the least,"" he added.

Indiana University at Bloomington on Thursday urged students living in fraternity and sorority houses to move out, citing an “alarming” rate of positive COVID-19 tests that marked the latest outbreak in the U.S. Midwest and at a college campus.
The university said on Twitter that positive tests for coronavirus were exceeding 50 per cent in some Greek houses, higher than in dorms, and told fraternity and sorority members to “re-evaluate their current living situation.”
“Based on an increasingly alarming rate of positive test results from continued COVID-19 mitigation testing, IU Bloomington and its public health experts believe Greek houses are not safe given the pandemic conditions,” the school tweeted.
Indiana University, a campus of some 40,000 students, said it lacked the authority to manage the privately owned houses, but hoped Greek organizations and landlords would work with students to help them make new arrangements.
Some students responding on social media accused the school of unfairly blaming the Greek system. Others said administrators should have expected outbreaks where a number of people were living in close quarters.
Major universities have grappled with thousands of students returning to campus for the fall semester, with some imposing online-only learning. New cases have spiked at some colleges that have allowed students to return to class.
New coronavirus infections have fallen nationwide for six weeks in a row but surged in the Midwest. Iowa, North Dakota and South Dakota are reporting the highest percentage of positive tests, over 20 per cent in each state.
Hundreds of thousands of motorcyclists descended on Sturgis, South Dakota, in August for an annual rally and health experts feared that could further spread the virus. On Wednesday a Minnesota health official said a motorcycle enthusiast in his 60s who had shown up there died of COVID-19.

HOLLYWOOD STAR TESTS POSITIVE
New coronavirus infections have fallen nationwide for six weeks in a row but surged in the Midwest. Iowa, North Dakota and South Dakota are reporting the highest percentage of positive tests, over 20% in each state.
Hundreds of thousands of motorcyclists descended on Sturgis, South Dakota, in August for an annual rally and health experts feared that could further spread the virus. On Wednesday a Minnesota health official said a motorcycle enthusiast in his 60s who had shown up there died of COVID-19.
New cases rose 27% last week in Minnesota and 34% in Indiana.
Among those who have tested positive in recent days are British actor Robert Pattinson, 35, bringing an abrupt halt to production of his film “The Batman” as Hollywood struggles to regain its footing following a pandemic shutdown.
The Baseball Hall of Fame said late on Wednesday that Tom Seaver, considered one of the sport’s greatest right-handed pitchers, had died of complications of COVID-19 and Lewy body dementia at the age of 75.
And pro-wrestler turned Hollywood actor Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, 48, said in a video message posted on social media on Wednesday that he, his wife and their two children had tested positive for COVID-19 in recent weeks but had since recovered
New York City on Thursday allowed malls to reopen their doors to shoppers at 50% capacity. Statewide, casinos can now operate at 25% capacity.
“Thanks to the hard work of New Yorkers, we are at a point in our fight against this virus where we can safely reopen malls in New York City as long as they adhere to strict health and safety protocols,” Governor Andrew Cuomo said.
New York has seen by far the most COVID-19 deaths of any U.S. state, with more than 32,000, but its rate of new infections has dropped to among the lowest in the nation.
At least 185,754 have died of the illness across the United States, according to a Reuters tally.

Some even purchased coronavirus “starter packs” for students equipped with university-branded masks, and even set aside special quarantine quarters for students that contract the virus.
But all that planning went out the window at some schools when clusters of coronavirus cases broke out within days of students returning to campus, forcing the schools to make a U-turn and revert to online instruction.
Back in March when colleges shifted to online learning, many, including Harvard University, continued to charge full tuition, and some students later filed lawsuits seeking refunds. Now colleges that shift to online instruction are struggling to justify their sometimes-hefty tuitions and other fees. They are under immense pressure to lower their tuitions, but few have done so.
Some schools, including those with significant endowments, have even raised tuition this year.
Notre Dame University switched to remote learning for two weeks after large outbreaks were reported. It reverted back to in-person instruction on Sept. 2. “We anticipate delivery of instruction in-person for the balance of the semester,” Paul Browne, a university spokesman, told MarketWatch. He said that it is “unknown” whether the school would give students a discount on tuition if it switches permanently to remote learning.
Temple University is taking a similar course of action and is halting in-person instruction for two weeks beginning the week of Aug. 31. The university has not announced any changes to tuition.
Don’t miss: These schools have the largest endowments in the country — yet they’re still raising tuition during the COVID pandemic
Here are some of the schools that are offering tuition breaks after shifting to online instruction
Northwestern University: Northwestern announced on Aug. 28 that first and second-year students “will not be allowed on campus” and “will begin the academic year on a remote-only basis.”
University president Morton Schapiro apologized to students for the sudden reversal, made nine days before students were due on campus, according to the Chicago Tribune. “I apologize for people who are so angry, and I understand that anger as a parent and as an educator,” Schapiro said. “In retrospect, I probably should have decided earlier in the week.”
Students will get a financial break. “As a result of the evolving nature of that decision and the financial impact on families, tuition is being reduced 10% for all undergraduates for the Fall Quarter,” Jon Yates, a university spokesman, told MarketWatch. The school increased its annual price to about $58,000 in June, the Chicago Tribune reported.
Georgetown University: Georgetown announced on July 21 that the majority of students would not be invited back for in-person instruction. Those students will receive a 10% reduction in tuition.
Williams College: In June, the college announced that it would be pursuing a plan to offer a hybrid of remote and in-person learning, and as of late August, it was sticking with that model. “In recognition of the extraordinary circumstances and of this academic year and the uncertainty we face in the year ahead, the total cost of attendance has been reduced by 15%,” a notice on the school’s site states.
Princeton University: In July, Princeton announced that only freshman and juniors would be allowed to attend in-person classes in the fall semester and that all students would receive a 10% tuition discount. In early August, the school announced that all classes will be taught remotely.
American University: The school announced a 10% tuition reduction in late July when the university informed students that the semester would be taught remotely.
Johns Hopkins University: In early August, Johns Hopkins announced a 10% tuition reduction after informing students that classes would be taught remotely.
Colleges that aren’t offering tuition breaks
Colorado College: After more than a dozen students tested positive for coronavirus, the private college announced on Sept. 1 that the remainder of the fall semester would be taught remotely. The college won’t be discounting tuition for the semester, but it is allowing students to take the equivalent of two extra classes in the winter and summer at no additional cost. A spokeswoman for the school said that amounts to approximately a $15,000 benefit.
North Carolina State University: Shortly after students returned to campus, multiple clusters — which the North Carolina Health Department defines as “five or more cases that are deemed close proximity or location” — were reported. As a result, the university announced on Aug. 20 that the remainder of the semester would be taught remotely. There have been no changes to tuition. The university declined to comment.
La Salle University: The school announced it would be shifting to remote learning on Aug. 20 but did not indicate whether there would be any tuition change for undergraduate students. The university did not respond to MarketWatch’s request for a comment.
Drexel University: The school announced that it would be shifting to remote learning for undergraduate students on Aug. 19. A limited number of graduate programs will be taught partially in-person. The university is not implementing a tuition hike which was set to take effect for the fall 2020 term.
Don’t miss: ‘It’s unlikely we can prevent widespread transmission of COVID-19 between students if our undergraduates return to campus’: College students on an unusual fall semester
Ithaca College: The college announced on Aug. 18 that it would not be welcoming students back to campus. Tuition for full-time undergraduate students is not being discounted. However the college is allowing students to take “three undergraduate credits in winter or summer term 2021 for no additional charge,” David Maley, a spokesman for the college, told MarketWatch.
Michigan State University: MSU abandoned its plans to offer in-person instruction, the university announced on Aug. 18. ” The value of a Michigan State education is significant and the format of instruction does not reduce that value,” Dan Olsen, a university spokesman, told MarketWatch. “For these reasons, MSU is not offering a tuition discount at this time.”
University of North Carolina: After more than 150 students tested positive for coronavirus within the first week of class, the university announced on Aug. 16 that it would switch undergraduate classes to remote instruction and reduce density in the residence halls.
“Tuition and fees are determined by the UNC System Board of Governors, which has determined that the current tuition and fee structure for the fall semester will remain in place for the 2020-21 academic year regardless of any changes in instructional format,” a university spokesperson told MarketWatch."
55,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2020/09/01/predicting-a-covid-19-outbreak-with-wastewater-analysis/,-0.813,Predicting A Covid-19 Outbreak With Wastewater Analysis,"Early in the Covid-19 pandemic, research showed that people infected with the novel coronavirus shed viral material in their feces. This has led to interest in what is sometimes called “sewage epidemiology” by public health officials.
Routine wastewater surveillance can be used as a vital early warning tool to alert communities to new coronavirus infections. This is because sewage or wastewater that goes through the drainage system to a treatment facility can indicate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in an area before the virus would normally be detected by way of individual PCR tests.
The Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) has outlined plans to map the outbreak of coronavirus across the Netherlands, using wastewater analysis. For this purpose, RIVM will be expanding the number of measuring points at water treatment plants from 80 to 300.
The RIVM wants to be able to establish not only that there are virus particles in the wastewater, but also approximately how many households those particles originate from. The agency has begun publishing the test results - number of virus particles in a milliter of wastewater - on the country’s coronavirus dashboard.
In late March, right after the peak in coronavirus transmissions, the RIVM began reporting wastewater measurement. The figure below shows that virus particles in wastewater fell sharply from the end of March through May, plateaued at a low level in June and the first part of July, rose in late July through mid August, and then began decreasing again.
Measurement of SARS-CoV-2 Particles in Dutch Wastewater
Public health officials don’t regard wastewater testing as a replacement of regular testing, rather as complementary to it. By itself, conventional PCR testing of individuals isn’t sufficient. This is due in part to the fact that many people are asymptomatic, and so they’re much less likely to get tested. And even when some people have possible symptoms of Covid-19 they may not be willing to get tested.
Wastewater testing offers a predictor map of the outbreak in a particular region that doesn’t rely on individuals’ willingness to get tested. Similarly, prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, efforts in sewage monitoring in a number of countries enabled detection of outbreaks of norovirus, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, polio, and measles.
Wastewater testing isn’t just something being done in the Netherlands. Tests at wastewater treatment plants in France have revealed levels of coronavirus that rose preceding an increase in confirmed clinical cases. In Israel, public health authorities regularly screen sewage and waste, as part of an early warning system. And, in the city of Ashkelon, researchers at Ben-Gurion University have been attempting to estimate the number of virus particles that patients shed. In the U.K., a network of scientists have collaborated with local water companies to collect samples of untreated sewage from treatment plants for testing.
In the U.S., municipalities in several states, including Colorado, Ohio, and New York, have taken steps toward implementing systematic wastewater surveillance efforts. On Thursday, September 3rd, Ohio’s Governor DeWine touted his state’s Coronavirus Wastewater Monitoring Network, a new effort to study wastewater at a number of sewage treatment plants to help contain the spread of coronavirus.
And, this summer at the University of Arizona scientists and staff set up a system to test wastewater across campus. At the end of August, using wastewater testing, school authorities were able to discover the presence of coronavirus in a particular dorm on campus. In turn, this triggered testing of individuals in the dorm, and isolation of two who tested positive. This possibly prevented a larger outbreak from happening.
The University of Arizona example illustrates how wastewater testing in conjunction with follow-up testing with rapid results can halt a campus-wide outbreak in its tracks.
Wastewater surveillance appears to be expanding to other places of higher education in the U.S. The Rochester Institute of Technology in New York is currently testing wastewater for coronavirus. And, the University of North Carolina at Charlotte is planning to deploy wastewater analysis at its dorms once students arrive there later this month.
Sewage sampling provides a relatively inexpensive, yet comprehensive overview of the actual viral load in a community, a week or two earlier than existing PCR tests done on individuals. But, the U.S. lacks comprehensive state and local efforts in this area, let alone a national coronavirus wastewater testing program.
A national wastewater surveillance program could offer a potentially cost-effective approach to track coronavirus across the U.S. population and provide early warning of an initial outbreak or a recurrence of the virus."

The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment also reported the first cluster linked to fighting the state’s wildfires on Wednesday. Four people involved in responding to the Cameron Peak fire tested positive for COVID-19. The state hasn’t released information about what kind of work the four did.
The new school clusters brought the total to four K-12 buildings in Colorado with reported outbreaks. Other schools have reported cases, but the state health department only declares an outbreak if at least two cases are believed to come from being in the same location within two weeks. Students and staff who test positive on the first day aren’t counted as an outbreak, unless there’s evidence of some out-of-school link they shared.
Sand Creek Elementary School, in Highlands Ranch, reported one staff member and two students had tested positive as of Wednesday.
The other two new outbreaks were in Monument. Bear Creek Elementary School reported one staff case and two student cases, while Monument Academy reported one case in a staff member and one in a student.
Battle Mountain High School’s outbreak is still considered ongoing, but no new cases have been reported since last week, when two staff members tested positive. CDPHE doesn’t consider an outbreak over until four weeks have passed with no new cases linked to linked to a location or event.
One previously reported outbreak, at Compass Montessori in Jefferson County, was reclassified as a child care center instead of a school. No new cases have been reported since last week, when the state said two staff members had tested positive.
Outbreaks have popped up in 16 other child care facilities, and 10 are still ongoing. No deaths have been linked to those facilities.
Only one university outbreak is considered ongoing. Colorado College has reported 14 confirmed or suspected cases among students, and none among staff. Outbreaks linked to athletic programs at Colorado State University, University of Northern Colorado and University of Colorado have been resolved, as have clusters among CSU fraternity members and University of Denver staff.
The largest outbreaks in the state remained mostly unchanged this week, though the cluster among Denver’s homeless population did climb to the fifth-highest spot. Initially, the state reported outbreaks in homeless shelters separately, but officials changed the counting method as it became clear that the shelters’ clients often sought help in multiple places where the virus was spreading.
The largest outbreaks were:
Sterling Correctional Facility: 611 cases, three deaths (three new cases since last week)
Van Cise-Simonet Detention Center, Denver: 568 cases, no deaths (16 new cases)
JBS meatpacking plant, Greeley: 293 cases, six deaths (no new cases)
Buena Vista Correctional Complex: 212 cases, no deaths (no new cases)
People experiencing homelessness, Denver: 156 cases, no deaths (15 new cases)
Pikes Peak Center nursing home, Colorado Springs: 146 cases, 26 deaths (no new cases)
Steven Roberts Original Desserts, Aurora: 139 cases, one death (one new case)
Elms Haven Center, Thornton: 104 cases, seven deaths (44 new cases and two new deaths)
Laurel Manor Care Center, Colorado Springs: 86 cases, 14 deaths (no new cases)
Denver County Jail: 83 cases, no deaths (one new case)
The counts include both confirmed and probable cases, for consistency. At the beginning of the outbreak, shortages made it difficult to test everyone who had symptoms of the new coronavirus.

In this week's modeling data, the number of repopulating college towns that have heightened risk for widespread community transmission far outnumber the few campuses that appear to be conferring no new risk to their communities. This is especially notable in regions that reported high case counts before students arrived again, such as the South and Midwest, where the reopening of colleges and some K-12 schools has quickly accelerated the risk for widespread transmission and increasing test positivity rates in the coming weeks. The increasing risk is particularly of concern for smaller college towns—such as Morgantown, W.Va., State College, Pa., and Bloomington, Ind.—that have already seen campus outbreaks. Furthermore, more than two weeks into the new semester, test positivity rates remain over 10% in Iowa City, Tuscaloosa, Ala., and Boone, Mo.
The researchers are watching very closely for impacts across Minnesota, which is seeing some of the highest risk in the PolicyLab model, as the state forges ahead with reopening K-12 schools and colleges simultaneously, while being located in a part of the country that sees some of the earliest arrival of colder weather. Finally, data validity concerns in Mississippi and Texas, and growing risk for virus resurgence in parts of Tennessee, South Carolina, and North Carolina, are reasons to closely monitor forecasts in the South over the next few weeks.
Aside from the challenges that school reopenings are bringing to communities, the forecasting model projects that case counts will likely continue to decline over the next four weeks in many major metropolitan areas across California, including San Diego and San Francisco, and Florida, including Miami and Orlando. The researchers also observed some stabilization in parts of New England—such as Boston and Providence—and modest improvements in projections for Baltimore and other parts of Maryland, as forecasted risk declines in coastal counties. The forecasts for these northern areas, as well those for Denver, Seattle and its neighboring communities in the Pacific Northwest, are becoming more favorable for safely reopening schools for in-person learning, as per PolicyLab's school reopening guidance and recommended test positivity and case incidence thresholds, assuming college openings do not add new risk.
""While we feel relieved to see improving forecasts for much of California and Florida, and some stabilization in the Northeast, the challenging situation in the Midwest and Heartland has us very concerned for the health and safety of those communities in the weeks ahead,"" said David Rubin, MD, MSCE, director of PolicyLab at CHOP and a professor of Pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine. ""We know clearly now that, despite best efforts, college reopenings have not been going well in areas of high transmission. Although the virus is spreading among younger, often healthier adults, we are mindful that these students don't live in a bubble. Monitoring emergency department and hospital visit rates in these communities over the next 2-3 weeks will be informative as to the sustainability of these outbreaks.""

Background
Researchers at PolicyLab at CHOP and the University of Pennsylvania developed the model, known as COVID-Lab: Mapping COVID-19 in Your Community, which tracks COVID-19 transmission and test positivity rates across all U.S. counties, and projects case counts for 817 counties with active outbreaks, representing 82% of the U.S. population and 88% of all identified coronavirus cases. The researchers built their model to observe how social distancing, population density, daily temperatures, and humidity affect the number and spread of COVID-19 infections over time across a county, accounting for test positivity rates and population characteristics such as age, insurance status, crowding within homes and diabetes prevalence. COVID-Lab's projections forecast the number of coronavirus cases communities could experience over the next four weeks based on a three-day average of their current social distancing practices, defined by the change in travel to non-essential businesses as compared to pre-epidemic. This is just one tool in a toolbox of resources policymakers and decision-makers can use as they manage their COVID-19 response efforts.
The application of this model, which focuses on time-varying transmission rates during the early months of the pandemic in the U.S., was released on July 23, following peer review, in JAMA Network Open. You can read more about how the team validates their models for accuracy in this blog post. The data are publicly available in the form of interactive maps and graphs.

The school also announced Monday plans for mobile saliva testing of students in university housing hotspots found by testing wastewater.
Three more Greek Village houses were placed under quarantine. The total has reached nine — or close to half of all the Greek houses in the neighborhood off Blossom Street.
USC has now issued interim suspensions of six Greek houses for hosting parties with alcohol and to 15 students for hosting large parties and breaking quarantine.
The school with more than 30,000 students has filled all the quarantine beds at the Bates West down and is sending students to residences at the National Advocacy Center, spokesman Jeff Stensland said.
Roughly one in three of USC’s quarantine beds were filled as of Thursday, the latest data available. The school has not released how many beds are being used to house infected or exposed students.
USC reported 557 active COVID-19 cases as of Thursday, nearly a 500 percent increase from the previous weekend, the first since fall semester classes resumed with some in-person instruction.
Student cases have been either asymptomatic or involving minor COVID-19 symptoms before testing, the school said. No students have required hospitalization.
The school’s outbreak has begun showing up in the state’s daily COVID-19 reports. Richland County posted nearly four times more positive tests than the county with the next highest number of cases over the weekend. Some of USC’s coronavirus testing data was not submitted until the weekend because of a technical glitch.
Still, the school’s alert level remains “low” on the 11 criteria, including testing and supplies, it is following to see if the school needs to end in-person classes and close dorms. USC was the only major public college in the state to resume with some in-person classes.
USC President Bob Caslen remains hopeful to keep open the campus, but he asked his staff to prepare closing plans as more than 450 students were infected last week.
USC hopes to stop large outbreaks by having teams ready to visit hotspots in dorms and offer saliva tests quickly to find students infected. Before, students near people who became infected were told to go out and get tests. The hotspots will be detected with wastewater testing the school is conducting that can show spikes in infections.
Off-campus parties continue to be a concern, but a new Columbia city ordinance will punish landlords who allow large gatherings during the pandemic. Still, the school is seeing fewer large off-campus parties this year than in the past, a sign that some students are listening to safety concerns, Stensland said."

The announcement from Dr. Joneigh Khaldun comes as schools reopen across the state and amid ongoing calls for additional transparency about critical medical information from parents, teachers and news media.

""We're currently working with our local health departments to gather names of specific schools that have outbreaks associated with them,"" Khaldun said.
""I continue to be incredibly proud of the dedication and expertise of our local health officers and their staff, who are really on the front lines of fighting this disease. We're going to continue to work with them to update our data reporting.""
Khaldun said the state will start posting the information online in the next two weeks.
Last week, local health departments identified 93 new outbreaks of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. As of Sunday, there were eight new or ongoing outbreaks connected to K-12 schools across the state. An additional six outbreaks at colleges and universities are new or ongoing, according to the state.
The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services said an outbreak is generally defined as two or more cases linked to the same place and time, indicating a shared exposure to the coronavirus that occurred outside of a household.
In August, state lawmakers and the governor agreed on a legislative package that gave school districts the flexibility to decide how to safely educate students this year. Districts are allowed to decide whether they want to offer face-to-face classes, virtual courses or a combination, as long as the plans they implement were crafted with the input of local health officials.
Despite overall case rates trending down, students returning to classes are fueling some outbreaks.
At Adrian College, more than 6.5% of students and staff have tested positive since fall classes began Aug. 24. More than 100 of those who've tested positive remain on campus, quarantining in dorms where healthy students also live.
In August, health officials in Isabella County declared a health emergency after dozens of new cases were attributed to students returning to campus at Central Michigan University.
Khaldun's announcement comes one day after the Free Press and many other Michigan media outlets called on Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to release the names of schools tied to outbreaks.
To address COVID-19 testing in communities across Michigan, Whitmer and the health department also announced Wednesday the creation of 12 neighborhood testing sites. Testing will be free at these sites, located in community pillars like churches, colleges and nonprofits.
There are three sites up and running Detroit, with additional sites opening this week in Albion, Ecorse, Flint, Grayling and Roseville. More sites are planned in Benton Harbor, Grand Rapids, Lansing, Muskegon, Niles, Saginaw and Wayne in the near future, bringing the total number of sites above 20, according to the announcement.

A return to campus for the new academic year has colleges and universities struggling to both contain outbreaks of COVID-19 and enforce policies meant to prevent its spread.
Across the United States, at least 36 states have reported positive cases at colleges and universities, adding more than 8,700 cases to the country's overall tally.
More than 5.9 million infections have been recorded in the United States, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Since classes started on Aug. 19, 1,200 students at the University of Alabama have tested positive for the virus, the university system's website showed Saturday. Classes at the University of Dayton will continue online for at least two weeks after the school reported 116 cases on Thursday and then another 148 on Friday, according to the university's website.
Outbreaks have been identified at four different sororities at Kansas State University, according to news releases from the college and the Riley County Health Department.
Providence College in Rhode Island has implemented policies to prevent the virus' spread, but 17 students have been placed on ""interim suspension"" for violating those measures, meaning they will not be allowed on campus or in classes until they attend a hearing, college spokesperson Steven Maurano told CNN Saturday.
""I am deeply disappointed by the selfish behavior of these students who defiantly chose to ignore our COVID-19 Code of Conduct,"" Fr. Kenneth R. Sicard, O.P., the college's president, said in a statement. ""While I find no joy in having to endorse such strong sanctions, I know they are necessary if we are going to have a successful fall semester.""

New Mexico’s biggest universities have avoided large COVID-19 outbreaks through the early weeks of the fall semester.
And officials on the campuses plan to use a variety of tactics – such as testing wastewater, snuffing out parties before they start, creating outdoor study spaces and deploying “mask ambassadors” to encourage safe practices – to try and keep it that way.
Universities around the country are reporting spikes in COVID-19 cases, but New Mexico’s public universities have moved a significant amount of coursework online. New Mexico campuses have also limited the number of students living in dormitories this fall and taken other measures to try to slow the spread of coronavirus.
The University of New Mexico has had six cases since school reopened on Aug. 17. Five of those cases were students and one was an employee, said Carla Domenici, director of finance and administration for strategic initiatives, who has been named the school’s COVID coordinator.
“The leadership at UNM and the (Health Sciences Center) worked diligently (over the summer),” she said. “I think that hard work and thoughtfulness has worked.”
New Mexico State University on Wednesday reported seven “active cases” among students at the university and two employees with active cases. A total of 64 students and 29 university employees have tested positive since March, according to a database on NMSU’s website.
UNM has had 34 total cases across its main and branch campuses since the start of the pandemic, according to the university’s COVID dashboard, which went live this week.
Western New Mexico University required COVID tests for all 277 students moving into residence halls on the campus in Silver City this semester. The testing found nine cases, and those students were quarantined, according to Isaac Brundage, vice president for student affairs. The university’s follow-up contact tracing led to another round of rapid testing by Hidalgo Medical Services, which uncovered two more cases on the campus.
“Because of the diligent planning WNMU conducted over the past few months, we have been successful in minimizing the spread to both our campus and local community,” Brundage said in an email.
New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology hasn’t had any positive cases on campus, said Thom Guengerich, a spokesman. Northern New Mexico College also hasn’t been made aware of any cases on its campus, according to a spokeswoman.
Officials at Eastern New Mexico University couldn’t be reached for comment.
New Mexico Highlands University has had seven cases at its campus in Las Vegas, all detected through required tests of student athletes, said Sean Weaver, a spokesman for the university.
“New Mexico universities really stepped up to meet those challenges, and it was a difficult line to walk,” he said.
Such has not been the case throughout the country. Many schools started the semester with outbreaks of disease – the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Central Florida each had more than 700 cases last week, according to a database created by The New York Times.
Regionally, Texas Tech University and University of Texas El Paso each had 103 cases, and the University of Arizona had 78, according to the database, which was last updated Aug. 25.
Some schools, such as Ohio State and Purdue universities, have suspended dozens of students because of large gatherings.
At UNM and NMSU, school officials said students have been given new conduct codes that require them to wear masks and socially distance. The colleges’ deans of students will also be trying to monitor off-campus behavior to some extent, but the schools have not been made aware of parties, the officials said.
The cases at UNM and NMSU reflect anyone who tested positive for coronavirus through campus testing, and those who self-reported their diagnosis. Once the schools are aware of a positive test, they have contact tracers who will work to determine whether others on campus are at risk.
UNM is sending “mask ambassadors” throughout campus to encourage healthy habits. Both UNM and NMSU created large outdoor seating areas where students can study or socialize at distance.
At NMSU, researchers are working to create a system for testing wastewater for signs of the virus. The technique has already been deployed at other colleges throughout the country, with the goal being to detect coronavirus in feces before a person starts to show symptoms.
Testing a particular area on campus, such as a residential hall or athletic complex, could give the schools an early warning as to where the virus is present, said Lori McKee, director of health and wellness at NMSU.
Both UNM and NMSU also said they’ve been in contact with fraternities, sororities and dorm residents, and warned them against holding large gatherings. Domenici and McKee said there could be consequences if students who are part of a campus organization hold such a party, even off campus.
“So far, knock on wood, we haven’t had any offense of large parties reported. Of course, our dean of students would take care of those allegations,” McKee said. “We’ve worked really hard to mitigate the risk on campus. We understood when we came back to campus that it was a risk.”"
62,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/08/28/arizona-coronavirus-wastewater-testing/,-0.909,The University of Arizona says it caught a dorm’s covid-19 outbreak before it started. Its secret weapon: Poop.,"As 5,000 students prepared for move-in day at the University of Arizona this week, the school warned they would be tested periodically for the coronavirus. One test, though, doesn’t involve a nose swab. The university is regularly screening the sewage from each dorm, searching for traces of the virus.
On Thursday, officials said the technique worked — and possibly prevented a sizable outbreak on campus. When a wastewater sample from one dorm came back positive this week, the school quickly tested all 311 people who live and work there and found two asymptomatic students who tested positive. They were quickly quarantined.
“With this early detection, we jumped on it right away, tested those youngsters, and got them the appropriate isolation where they needed to be,” said Richard Carmona, a former U.S. surgeon general who is directing the school’s reentry task force, in a news conference.
Researchers around the world have been studying whether wastewater testing can effectively catch cases early to prevent covid-19 clusters. There are programs in Singapore, China, Spain, Canada and New Zealand, while in the United States, more than 170 wastewater facilities across 37 states are being tested. Earlier this month, officials in Britain announced testing at 44 water treatment facilities. The Netherlands has been collecting samples at 300 sewage treatment plants.
With colleges battling large outbreaks around the country, the University of Arizona — which is trying a mix of online and in-person courses — elected to test sewage from all 20 residence halls. Other schools are doing the same, including the University of California at San Diego and Syracuse University.
On Tuesday at the University of Arizona, that screening process found signs of the virus in the wastewater from a dorm called Likins Hall. Although all students living in the dorm had to pass antigen tests before moving in, the second screening after the wastewater alert found the two positive cases.
Carmona said without the sewage testing, those two asymptomatic students could have spread the virus far before it was detected.
“You think about if we had missed it, if we had waited until they became symptomatic and they stayed in that dorm for days, or a week, or the whole incubation period, how many other people would have been infected?” he said.
Wastewater testing has been used for years to test for other viruses, to study illicit drug use and to understand the socioeconomic status of a community based on its food consumption, according to Kevin Thomas, director of the University of Queensland’s Alliance for Environmental Health Sciences. Thomas has been working with a federal research agency to develop techniques on how to best detect traces of the virus in Australia. Wastewater testing is effective because fragments of the virus stay in feces, he said.
“I really do think it’s a good demonstration of the technique and technology because all the researchers working in this space internationally have come to the conclusion that is a very good early warning system,” Thomas said of Arizona’s experience in an interview with The Washington Post.
The process used to test the effluent is the same as those used for nose swab tests, which involves “concentrating the fragments within the sample and then extracting the RNA,” Thomas said.
At the University of Arizona, the procedure can also study whether the university’s efforts to curb infection rates have been effective, said Ian Pepper, director of the University of Arizona’s Water and Energy Sustainable Technology Center, in a news release.
“The approach can also be used to help determine if an intervention is working to reduce the transmission of the virus,” he said.
As of Thursday, the university has had 46 positives amid more than 10,000 antigen tests. But students have been on campus for only a week. New cases in Arizona have fallen 25 percent this past week, according to The Post’s coronavirus case tracker. There have been more than 200,000 cases and almost 5,000 deaths in the state since the end of February.
University of Arizona President Robert C. Robbins said that numbers will go up on campus. “It’s inevitable,” he said in the news conference. “The issue is going to be can we handle the steady flow of cases or do we get a big spike in cases that overwhelms our ability to isolate and continue to test.”
That scenario has already played out at a number of schools, including Notre Dame, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Michigan State University, forcing them to switch to online classes only. At the University of Alabama, where 530 cases were detected the first week, school officials suspended students who violated social distancing rules by attending parties.
Thomas said that as some colleges bring students back on campus, testing wastewater from dorms could be an effective technique — along with individual testing and contact tracing — to manage the spread of the virus.
“The proof is there that it works, and it does seem to be a very sensitive approach,” Thomas said. “I think it’s a proactive way of trying to manage the potential for infection on campus.”"

Cuomo Deploys SWAT Team to SUNY Oneonta to Contain COVID-19 Outbreak,"Governor Andrew Cuomo has dispatched a COVID “SWAT” team to SUNY Oneonta after 105 students test positive for the virus. On Wednesday, 71 contract tracers and eight case investigators from the New York State Department of Health will set up 15- minute rapid testing sites on campus.
The infection that spread at SUNY Oneonta has been linked to several student parties in and around campus, state officials said. Three campus organizations and five students have been suspended for participating, WNBC-TV reported.
SUNY Oneonta's Incoming Chancellor, Jim Malatras said the school will close for in-person instruction for the next two weeks. The suspension went into effect Sun. Aug. 30 at 9 p.m. and run through Sept. 13. At that time state, school officials and the local health department will determine if it is safe for in-person learning to resume.
COVID-19 cases started to surface last week at SUNY Oneonta when undergraduate students returned to school for the fall semester. It was reported that only 20 people tested positive. However, once a SUNY upstate medical team was dispatched and 3,000 students were tested, the total number of confirmed cases of COVID 19 reached 105, representing 3% of the faculty, staff, and students who are on campus and using campus facilities, university officials said.
“Colleges are the canary in the coal mine, and a 3 percent infection rate is high in a congregate situation, similar to a dense urban environment where you have people taking public transportation,” Cuomo said. “That’s why we’re deploying state resources to contact the new COVID cluster at SUNY Oneonta.”
Cuomo applauded Malatras for his actions, saying, ""the chancellor is doing the exact right thing at Oneonta and I think he's taking the right actions across SUNY, and I think the private colleges should follow the example,"" reported by FOX News.
On Aug. 27, Cuomo announced that 100 cases are the minimum necessary to force a campus closure or an outbreak of 5 percent of the population. If a college outbreak occurs, students are required to do remote learning with limited on-campus activity for two weeks while the situation is evaluated by health officials. If the local health department finds the college cannot contain the outbreak even after the two weeks, the school may be required to continue remote learning or officials may impose other mitigation measures in consultation with the state health department.
The guidelines also state that if clusters of positive cases emerge on particular areas of campus while still below 5% or under 100 students, but ""strain the college's ability to isolate and contact trace,"" the college has to shift to 100% distance learning ""with limited on-campus activity.”
Athletic activities and other extracurricular activities must also be suspended, and the dining hall option must move to take-out only.
Last week it was reported that more than 1,000 University of Alabama students tested positive for COVID-19 since classes resumed. SUNY Plattsburg was another college that made news headlines when officials suspended over 40 students who attended unsanctioned parties. Marist, Montclair State University and UConn were other colleges that recently failed to adhere to state and school protocols. In nearly every case of these unauthorized gatherings, reported by school officials, there was a failure to social distance and wear appropriate face coverings, reported by NBC 4 NY.
To help contain the outbreak in the city of Oneonta, New York State will open three free, rapid-testing sites that city residents may visit that is available by appointment.

Seven students have tested positive this week as a result of the gatherings, including three reported Tuesday, and 47 students are being quarantined. If five or more students and employees in Laramie test positive for the virus in a single day, the university will implement its recently announced plan to pause its phased return to the fall semester.
Officials fear that could happen before in-person learning even begins.
Some of the quarantined students are in Greek Life housing, while others live elsewhere off campus. The school did not specify the types of gatherings that led to the infections.
Earlier this week, UW announced its plans for such a pause, should it become necessary because of a coronavirus outbreak. While this week’s cases do not yet trigger that pause, school leaders “warn that could be the case in the coming days as testing of the individual participants continues,” according to a Tuesday evening announcement.

Furman University on Wednesday announced it suspended one of its fraternities after it hosted unauthorized parties that resulted in the spread of COVID-19, according to the school's website.
Furman's Kappa Alpha chapter was suspended ""for a period of no less than four years,"" officials said in a letter to students, faculty, staff, alumni ad families.
The parties were hosted at the fraternity's former fraternity house on Aug. 21 and 22, officials said.
""Fifty-nine individuals have come forward to share they were present at the house during the aforementioned dates, and of those in attendance, nearly 60% have tested positive for COVID-19,"" officials said. That's about 35 people.
The letter did not identify any of the party-goers or those who tested positive specifically as students.
The school said those who tested positive have been quarantined, but there were delays in contact tracing because information was not immediately given about the parties and the people present.
""An outbreak that surpasses our ability to quarantine is one trigger that could cause us to go fully remote, and this matter quickly became an issue of wellbeing for our entire community,"" the letter said.
The school said Kappa Alpha recently ended a probationary period at the end of the spring 2020 term due to a previous conduct incident in spring 2019.
During that probationary period, officials said the chapter lost social privileges, participated in risk management trainings, engaged with headquarters’ consultant staff, and conducted a membership recommitment to the values and expectations of membership in Kappa Alpha in order to maintain membership.
Some of the students involved in the 2019 incident were in attendance at the most recent incident, officials said.

Officials from the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality and North Dakota Department of Agriculture said Wednesday, Sept. 2, they are investigating the mass deaths of monarch butterflies that sparked complaints and an online petition that has gathered more than 1,700 signatures urging the use of less toxic pesticides.
The North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality requires mosquito sprayers who apply pesticides over cities to file paperwork before the application to ensure safe chemicals and procedures are used, said Jim Semerad, the department’s air quality director.
That paperwork was submitted and approved before last week’s aerial application, after which residents in Fargo-Moorhead reported finding large numbers of dead monarchs and bees."

The Colorado Springs landmark has been declared an outbreak, and is on this week's list of 34 new sites.
The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment considers an entity an outbreak after two or more COVID-19 cases among residents, staffers or the like are confirmed within a fourteen-day period, or two or more cases of respiratory illness with an onset of symptoms within a fourteen-day period are paired with at least one additional COVID-19 diagnosis.
The growth of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths has stabilized in recent weeks, with positivity rates consistently below the 5 percent mark considered a warning sign by public-health officials — but the number of outbreaks hasn't waned. Data updated by the CDPHE yesterday, September 2, blew past the 600 outbreaks mark for the first time, with 156 active cases and 468 considered resolved. That's a total of 624, up from 590 a week earlier. The last time the CDPHE reported a weekly number higher than 34 was on May 20, when it listed 43 new outbreaks during the biggest increase in testing since the rise of the novel coronavirus.
More schools have been popping up on the roster since the restart of in-person instruction at many facilities, as illustrated by the latest stats. Making appearances are Bear Creek Elementary and Monument Academy in El Paso County, as well as Sand Creek Elementary in Douglas County. Also on the list is Colorado College in Colorado Springs, which has now opted to begin its year online after ten students tested positive; four others are considered probable victims of the disease.
Two more enterprises are experiencing second outbreaks: a Chick-fil-A in Adams County (the fast-food purveyor remains the chain with the most outbreaks in Colorado) and Laurel Manor Care Center, which has already seen more than its share of tragedy. Laurel's original outbreak, first reported in March, resulted in fourteen deaths; in the latest outbreak, eleven residents have tested positive, as have as many as seven staffers.
Other just-identified outbreaks of note include one at the Arapahoe County District Courthouse that's already considered resolved, another involving individuals battling the Cameron Peak fire, and spreads at a Larimer County tanning salon, a Jefferson County fire station, a Top Golf in Thornton and the Whole Foods in Tamarac Square — the first Colorado outbreak for the market giant.

68,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/latest-outbreaks-show-europe-is-struggling-with-covid-19-as-much-as-the-us,-3.752,Latest outbreaks show Europe is struggling with COVID-19 as much as the US,"Parts of Europe are seeing renewed COVID-19 outbreaks, illustrating that the continent as a whole has struggled to contain the virus as much or more than the United States has.
The number of cases across the EU jumped nearly 60% from the week ending June 28 through the week ending Aug. 30, according to data compiled by the World Health Organization.
Spain and France, in particular, have seen major outbreaks in recent weeks.
Spain has seen 125 cases per 100,000 people in the past week, more than the 90 per 100,000 in the U.S., according to data aggregated by the New York Times.
“It's almost like a mountain system, and you go up a hill, and then you have that flat area, and you rise again and fall down again … It’s part of one big wave that has peaks on it,” said Dr. Wafaa El Sadr, director of the Global Health Initiative at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University.
France is near its worst outbreak yet, registering more than 7,000 new cases Wednesday. Already, it was near 60 cases per 100,000 people.
Italy, Germany, and other countries have also seen rising cases. Overall, the ratio of total reported cases in the U.S. versus the EU has fallen from 20 to 1 less than two months ago to roughly 3 to 1.
The rise in cases in countries that pursued strict measures to control transmission of the virus earlier in the year shows the risks that apply everywhere.
“No country can just pretend the pandemic is over,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said this week. “The reality is that this coronavirus spreads easily, it can be fatal to people of all ages, and most people remain susceptible.”
Of course, reported cases are just one measure of the seriousness of an outbreak and the gauge most susceptible to problems with testing and reporting.
Deaths, the clearest indication, have yet to rise significantly in Spain and France. Yet, they are expected to increase because it takes weeks or months for COVID-19 patients to get sick, die, and be recorded as dying from the disease.
“[Mortality is] the last thing that goes up, but then later, it’s very difficult to bring it down because groups of patients in a very serious condition start to accumulate in hospitals and often they do not progress well,” said Francisco Javier Falo, the general director of public health in Aragon, Spain.
Even then, deaths might not be recorded properly or missed altogether. For that reason, the clearest indication of the pandemic’s toll is excess deaths, that is, the excess of total deaths in a region over a historical average.
By that standard, Europe has not fared better than the U.S. since the start of the pandemic.
For instance, even before the latest surge in cases, Spain had suffered an excess death rate of 95 per 100,000 since the start of the pandemic. The corresponding figure for the U.S. is 66.
In fact, the U.S. is about in the middle of the pack of European countries. The United Kingdom, Italy, and Belgium have slightly higher excess death rates, while the Netherlands, Portugal, and France have slightly lower ones.
It’s worth noting, though, that Germany, a country of more than 80 million, has kept its excess death rate below 11 per 100,000. Several smaller countries, too, especially in Scandinavia, have avoided huge death tolls.
It is likely that the current outbreaks in Spain and elsewhere will be less deadly than the initial waves of the pandemic in the spring, just as the summer surge in Sun Belt states proved less deadly. People under 60, who are less at risk of death from COVID-19, make up a large portion of new cases in Spain, which has resulted in a mortality rate of about 6.6%, slightly over half the mortality rate during the height of the pandemic."

In a message sent to students and staff on Thursday, university president Richard Englert said most classes — an estimated 95% — will be conducted online instead.
Some essential in-person teaching will continue, including classes that are part of the school’s physical therapy and nursing programs.
“We will continue to work together as a community to ensure that students receive the quality education they expect from Temple and continue progress toward their degree,” said Englert.
Students living in university housing can opt to return home to complete their courses, according to the announcement. If they leave by Sept. 13, the school will fully refund their room and board for the fall semester.
Students who “want or need to remain on campus” can stay.
“Those students are welcome to remain, and we will make available the academic and other support services and activities that you need to succeed, including Temple’s high-quality health services,” said Englert.
On Sunday, the university announced that classes would be held online for two weeks.
But as of Wednesday, the university reported 212 active cases of COVID-19. All but one was designated as “on-campus.”
Between Friday and Sunday, active cases rose from 50 to 100. Between Sunday and Wednesday, that total eclipsed 200."

PARTICIPANTS at this year’s colloquium organized by the Nnamdi Azikiwe University Business School have observed that most businesses in the country have gone into coma as a result of the outbreak of COVID -19.
The 2020 visual colloquium, which dwelt on business survival, growth and concomitant improvement in the post-COVID -19 pandemic era, attracted participants from the private sector and the academia.
Speaking on the theme, ‘COVID-19 Pandemic: Sustainability of Livelihood and Businesses in Developing Economies’ the lead discussant, Professor Sunny Nwankwo, described COVID-19 as a ‘moderator variable’, noting that it had changed businesses and consumer behaviours across board.
He observed that prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, the Nigerian economy was already in crisis and suggested that the only way to improve the situation was for the policymakers to provide good governance and conducive environment that would enable businesses to thrive.
According to him, COVID-19 has exposed the poor infrastructure in the country, stressing that there was, therefore, the need for everybody to brace up and face the challenges posed by the pandemic.
“Poor enabling environment is the greatest obstacle of business development and it is manmade. We need to look at institutional credibility and preservation of businesses. Governments must take actions that will impact positively on the small and medium enterprises, especially in this COVID-19 era. They must provide the enabling environment and all hands should be on deck to survive the effects of the pandemic”, he said.
Managing director of Juhel Pharmaceuticals, Dr. Eric Okoye described COVID-19 as a big trauma to many businesses, noting that it had left most SMEs in coma. He decried what he described as multiple taxations on businesses by government, remarking that without SMEs, there would be no vibrant economy.
He called for the development of local technology and raw materials to stabilize the economy and charged academicians to proffer solutions to the sustainability of small and medium enterprises.
Director of Unizik Business School, Professor Austin Nonyelu stressed the need to re-jig the informal sector of the economy, which, according to him, play central role in the economic growth of developing countries.
“Government should re-energize the productive sector, sustain livelihood of producers and workers, especially those in lower long of the ladder.
“Because of COVID-19, there should be a moratorium on taxation so as to eliminate all the unnecessary charges on small scale producers, retailers and medium-term enterprises for the next one year. This will help to stimulate people who do business at that level to avoid economic crash”, Nonyelu said.
Other discussants at the colloquium include the vice-chancellor of the university, Professor Charles Esimone, the deputy director of the UNIZIK Business School, Dr. Chinedu Onyeizugbe, Professor Ezinne Nnabuife, Mrs Ugochi Akwiwu-Onyike of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation, and Mrs. Florence Igboayaka.

Gov. Laura Kelly announced Wednesday that Kansas will reverse course and start releasing the names and locations of active COVID-19 outbreaks in the state next week.
Until now, the state has only released this information when contract tracing is not possible. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) has left it to local health departments to discern whether the locations of active outbreaks should be shared with the public.
Starting next Wednesday, Sept. 9, active outbreak information, including the number of cases associated with each location, will be updated weekly on the KDHE website’s COVID-19 dashboard.
“With our children returning to school, sports resuming, and college campuses reopening — we’re seeing the largest increase in outbreaks to date,” Kelly said in a statement. “By sharing where the outbreaks take place, Kansans will be better informed about the threat of COVID-19 in their schools and communities, and will be better prepared to contain and stop the spread of the virus.”
Many active outbreaks, however, will still not be disclosed to the public. In Kansas, two or more cases associated with one known exposure constitutes an active outbreak.

According to Kelly’s announcement, locations of active outbreaks will generally be released when they have been linked to five or more confirmed cases. The names of private businesses will be made public only when they have been linked to 20 confirmed cases.
Kansas saw an increase of 26 outbreaks from last Wednesday to Friday — the highest increase in outbreaks to date, the officials said. To date, the state has had 43,940 cases and 458 deaths associated with the virus.
In June, The Star obtained a “classified” document listing the name and location of every COVID-19 outbreak as of May 19.
The confidential list, provided to The Star by Columbia University’s Brown Institute for Media Innovation, was attached to an email from the Kansas Health Alert Network, an invitation-only messaging system used by the KDHE. A spreadsheet provided the names of all known facilities with outbreaks to help local health departments better determine the sources of their cases.
Local officials were cautioned to hold the information closely.
“As needed, please share this list only with your local health department staff that are actively investigating cases of COVID-19,” read the unsigned message attached to the spreadsheet. “Please do not distribute this list further and please do not make the names of facilities outside of your county known publicly.
At least 846 cases and six deaths through May 19 were traced to the Lansing prison. The Tyson plant near Garden City had seen 571 cases and one death according to the document."
74,https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-summer-camps-covid19-outbreaks,-0.448,How four summer camps in Maine prevented COVID-19 outbreaks,"As the coronavirus hit communities across the United States over the summer, four overnight camps in Maine successfully kept the virus at bay.
Of 1,022 people who attended the summer camps, which included campers and staff members, only three people tested positive for COVID-19, researchers report August 26 in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. That’s because the people who came to Maine from 41 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, Bermuda and five other countries diligently followed public health measures put in place to stop transmission, the team says.
The camps’ success, as well as others including child care programs in Rhode Island that limited coronavirus transmission, could point to a path forward for places like schools that are reopening with in-person classes in the face of the ongoing pandemic, though challenges remain.
At the camps, a combination of testing, social bubbles, social distancing, masks, quarantine and isolation prevented outbreaks.
Before arriving at camp, officials told all 642 children and 380 staff members to quarantine with their households for 10 to 14 days. Attendees were also tested for COVID-19 five to seven days prior to arrival — with the exception of 12 people who had already been previously diagnosed. Four people tested positive for the virus and isolated for 10 days at home before heading off to one of the camps, which were in session at different times from mid-June to mid-August. (Three of the four camps ran for less than 50 days and the other went on for 62 days.)
Once on site, the campers and staff participated in daily symptom checks and activities held largely outdoors. They also hung out in small “bubbles,” or cohorts, that ranged from five to 44 people in size and became like family during the weeks at camp, the researchers say. If people interacted with anyone outside their group, masks and social distancing were required.
“We wanted to give the kids the ability to have a family unit at camp that they didn’t need to be masked or social distanced from,” says Laura Blaisdell, a pediatrician at Maine Medical Center Research Institute in Scarborough who worked on the new report.
Attendees came to Maine via car, bus and plane, and could have been exposed to the virus after their initial test, so officials retested the 1,006 attendees who had never had COVID-19 four to nine days after their arrival.
In that round of testing, two staff members and one camper from three different camps tested positive but never developed symptoms. Their cohorts were quarantined for two weeks, but still “were able to have a camp experience … and continue to have fun and play together,” Blaisdell says. The three positive cases didn’t transmit the virus to anyone else before they were identified. They each remained isolated until they had two negative test results.
Off to camp
More than 1,000 people from 41 U.S. states, as well as Puerto Rico, Bermuda and several other countries, attended summer camps in Maine from mid-June to mid-August. The map shown here indicates which states campers and staff members came from. (No one attended from states colored white.) A fair number of people traveled from states like Texas and Florida that were hit hard over the summer (seven-day daily average rate of coronavirus infection as calculated on July 1, shown), but the camps’ public health measures prevented outbreaks. States with less than 10 cases per 100,000 population are not designated.
Camp population, by home state, and states’ COVID-19 infection rates
Some people traveled to Maine from areas where COVID-19 cases were surging over the summer, including Texas, Arizona and Florida. But rigorous testing quickly identified potential spreaders, and small cohorts allowed officials to quickly identify those most at risk of catching the virus.
In that way, “cohorting is an unsung hero of public health intervention,” Blaisdell says.
While interventions like cohorts, social distancing and wearing masks can help reduce coronavirus transmission on their own to some extent, each method has limitations. Combining such strategies into a layered approach where people follow multiple guidelines to curb the virus’ spread, like the Maine camps did, can further protect the members of a community.
“Every public health layer is like a layer of Swiss cheese with a hole in it,” Blaisdell says. It’s the stacking of “multiple layers of cheese on top of each other that close those holes and makes for a robust [infectious] disease plan.”
By contrast, a summer camp in Georgia faced an outbreak of the virus even after requiring attendees to provide proof of a negative test before arrival. But there, campers were not required to wear masks, weren’t tested after they arrived at camp and participated in both indoor and outdoor activities (SN: 7/31/20).
Still, the isolated nature of the summer camps in Maine likely made creating a relatively COVID-19–free bubble much easier than it might be at K–12 schools or universities around the country, where people come and go and may not live on site (SN: 8/4/20). There were some staff members at the four camps in Maine who went home every day, but those people were required to wear masks at all times and social distance from other attendees. It also likely helped that the amount of coronavirus circulating in Maine was quite low while the camps were running.
What’s more, the larger the school, the harder it will probably be to make sure that public health interventions are being adhered to. “If you follow the rules, then this can absolutely be successful,” says Brian Nichols, a virologist at Seton Hall University in South Orange, N.J. But, “when you scale it up and start looking at public schools and universities, you just have to plan on the fact that some people aren’t going to follow the rules.”
Nevertheless, the success in Maine hints that containing the virus is possible with a targeted, layered approach, Blaisdell says. “As schools and colleges begin to consider opening, they need to look at their community as a bubble,” she says. “We all need to be making contracts with each other about the behaviors that we’re going to do.”

(FOX Carolina) - Furman University officials say a fraternity chapter is suspended after a COVID-19 outbreak was tied to parties held by members last weekend.
In updates posted online this week, Furman officials say the Iota chapter of the Kappa Alpha Order reportedly hosted parties on August 21 and 22 at the former fraternity house off campus. As a result, the university moved to quarantine 53 students due to possible exposure to the virus. Contact tracers with the university have also been speaking with attendees to figure out how many close contacts they had with others.
We've reached out to national leaders with the Kappa Alpha Order for comment on the suspension. According to the list of its more than 130 active collegiate chapters, the Iota chapter lists 53 chapter members as of writing.
On Friday, August 28, university officials announced that a COVID-19 outbreak did indeed happen, and it was the first for the campus community with eight positive cases connected to the parties. Furman leaders say more tests were administered on Friday as well, and that the school's own COVID-19 Dashboard will update Monday afternoon to reflect some or all of the new cases depending on when the test results are returned.
""Students, we don’t know how to make this any clearer: If these types of gatherings continue, we will not be able to continue in-person classes through November 20. We want you to socialize and have safe fun, but you must adhere to the guidelines that have been established in the Paladin Promise and detailed on the Furman Focused website. This is the only way universities, including Furman, can continue in-person classes during a pandemic,"" said part of the university's second announcement on August 28.
Furman notes the parties were not registered, and that along with the suspension of Kappa Alpha Order activities until a student organization conduct process is complete, leaders are also reviewing whether individual conduct action for violations of the Paladin Promise and other Student Conduct Code polices is appropriate. Students who violate the promise may be subject to discipline, as outlined here.
Student who think they have been exposed to the virus need to contact Earle Student Health Center by emailing furmanstudenthealth@prismahealth.org.
During a live interview with Cody Alcorn on The Five O'Clock News on August 28, Dr. Marcus Blackstone - the chief clinical officer with the Bon Secours St. Francis Health System - said colleges and universities provide a unique concern for COVID-19 outbreaks.
""The concern is really with colleges. With K-12, there's a plan to make sure the precautions are all in place,"" said Blackstone. ""That has been our concern all along is when a group gathers in a college setting."""

A return to campus for the new academic year has colleges and universities struggling to both contain outbreaks of COVID-19 and enforce policies meant to prevent its spread.
Across the United States, at least 36 states have reported positive cases at colleges and universities, adding more than 8,700 cases to the country's overall tally.
More than 5.9 million infections have been recorded in the United States, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Since classes started on Aug. 19, 1,200 students at the University of Alabama have tested positive for the virus, the university system's website showed Saturday. Classes at the University of Dayton will continue online for at least two weeks after the school reported 116 cases on Thursday and then another 148 on Friday, according to the university's website.
Outbreaks have been identified at four different sororities at Kansas State University, according to news releases from the college and the Riley County Health Department.
Providence College in Rhode Island has implemented policies to prevent the virus' spread, but 17 students have been placed on ""interim suspension"" for violating those measures, meaning they will not be allowed on campus or in classes until they attend a hearing, college spokesperson Steven Maurano told CNN Saturday.
""I am deeply disappointed by the selfish behavior of these students who defiantly chose to ignore our COVID-19 Code of Conduct,"" Fr. Kenneth R. Sicard, O.P., the college's president, said in a statement. ""While I find no joy in having to endorse such strong sanctions, I know they are necessary if we are going to have a successful fall semester.""

There are numerous testing stations for the coronavirus throughout the region, at hospitals, physicians’ offices, drive-up sites at senior centers and even soup kitchens. But a different type of testing is taking place daily in Norwich and New London, with samples sent to Yale University to try to detect whether a COVID-19 outbreak is coming.
Jordan Peccia, professor of environmental engineering at Yale University, is heading a state-funded study of how the COVID-19 virus detected in raw sewage could help predict whether an infection outbreak can be expected in a certain area. Similar studies across the country have yielded promising results, including one study that was able to detect a pending outbreak in a University of Arizona dormitory before students had shown any symptoms of COVID-19.
The Yale study started Aug. 3 and now includes samples from seven sewage treatment plans in Norwich, New London, Hartford, New Haven and Bridgeport. But a preliminary study that started March 13 with the New Haven sewage treatment plant, Peccia said last week, and was able to detect an outbreak in the city in its early stage.
“If an outbreak occurs, we may be able to see it early,” Peccia said. “It will show up in the sewage plant as soon as people start shedding the virus. (COVID-19) testing can be delayed. Reporting of test results can get delayed. We typically can see a signal in the wastewater before you see it in testing.”
New London sewage includes flow from parts of Waterford and East Lyme. The Norwich sewage treatment plant serves parts of Franklin, Sprague, Preston, Bozrah and Lisbon.
Peccia said the Yale study is global for the participating treatment plants, not isolating samples from specific parts of the participating cities and towns, as the Arizona University did by studying sewage flow from individual dorms. He thinks it would be a good idea to isolate certain segments of a city, such as a nursing home or a school.
Larry Sullivan, Norwich Public Utilities wastewater integrity manager, said at the local sewage treatment plants staff take samples every day and store the small vials of raw sewage in a refrigerated container. On Monday and Thursday mornings, a Norwich sewage plant operator takes that morning’s samples, puts it and the previous few days’ collection of vials into a small, thick foam cooler and drives to the New London plant to pick up its week’s samples. The Norwich operator then drives to the New Haven laboratory, where the samples are tested.
A team of researchers at the Yale School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, including Ph.D. students and a lab tech overseen by Peccia, analyzes the samples.
Peccia has been doing research for more than 20 years on environmental pathogens in wastewater and the connection to public health issues. He has researched the possible presence of polio in wastewater and has been finding different strains of coronavirus in wastewater over the years.
In addition to early detection of an outbreak, the study also could detect when COVID-19 is declining in an area to help state and local leaders make decisions on reopening businesses, sports, schools and other activities.
Peccia said it’s important for smaller cities, such as Norwich and New London, to be included because they might not have the infrastructure in place for a major outbreak, and advance notice could help bring in state and federal assistance.
“If you have people getting sick in a smaller place, you’re pretty sure to see it in the sludge,” he said.
Peccia said the $180,000 study, funded by the state Department of Public Health, is scheduled to run through January 2021. No results have been released yet, with the study just ramping up a month into sampling. He said after the analysis, a report will be presented to DPH.
Joe Lanzafame, head of the New London Department of Public Utilities and Stormwater Authority, said the city received a call from the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection asking if the city was interested in being part of the study.
Lanzafame said the city was “excited” to join the study at the start, with the first samples taken Aug. 3.
Sullivan said NPU General Manager Chris LaRose learned about the study, reached out and asked to join it, offering to transport Norwich and New London samples to New Haven if the city could be added.
The first Norwich samples were taken Aug. 12, “at the tail end” of the COVID-19 outbreak at the Three Rivers Healthcare nursing home on Crouch Avenue, Peccia said.
“This is important from a public health standpoint,” NPU spokesman Chris Riley said. “But it also shows our willingness to participate when we can be of service. This could be enormously helpful to the health of the community.”

It's easier to isolate sick or exposed students and trace their contacts if they stay put, said Ravina Kullar, epidemiologist and spokesperson for Infectious Diseases Society of America. Sending students home risks exposing other people there as well as along the way, and makes contact tracing all but impossible.
""There's just inevitably going to be an outbreak,"" she said. ""Colleges need to take on the burden of having these students kept at their campus and taking care of them.""
The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill was one of the first to reverse in-person learning, sending students home to complete the semester remotely after the school had an outbreak. Colleges including Towson University and East Carolina University have done the same.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Aug. 27 that schools in the state would switch to online learning for two weeks if they record 100 cases or 5% of the population gets infected, keeping students in place while tamping the virus's spread. The University of Notre Dame adopted the same strategy, and announced Friday that it will resume in-person classes on Sept. 2.
U.S. President Donald Trump spoke of the risk this month while urging campuses to reopen, saying that sending students home after an outbreak could put relatives at risk. ""Instead of saving lives, a decision to close universities could cost lives,"" he said.
Notre Dame President John Jenkins had initially leaned toward clearing the campus when cases shot up to 147 less than two weeks after the first person was diagnosed. The county's deputy health officer, Mark Fox, persuaded him to make classes remote and clamp down on interactions first to see if that could slow the spread.
Notre Dame had a solid plan for reopening its campus, Fox said. The challenge was the magnitude and the velocity of cases, he said. When it hit, the school ramped up testing, added more isolation beds and expanded contact tracing. Together with tight restrictions on interactions between those living on and off campus, Notre Dame slowed cases from jumping to communities surrounding the school.
If students live relatively nearby or are in-state, tracers can do their job, said Howard Koh, former assistant secretary for health for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health professor. If students leave the state to go home, it's less effective.
""That will make the job very difficult, if not impossible,"" he said.
Contact tracing can help manage outbreaks when done correctly. The U.S. has struggled with it for many reasons, including getting people to answer the phone and respond truthfully. That's even harder at college, when students worry about being disciplined for violating rules: Many schools have limited parties and other gatherings to reduce Covid-19 risks. Young people also relish finally being back with their friends.
""The more contacts a person has, the harder contact tracing can be,"" said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. ""People may not even know who they're in contact with, especially if they are drinking.""
Effective programs interview a patient as soon as possible after a diagnosis to find out where they went while contagious, then contact anyone they encountered about their possible exposure. It's usually recommended those contacts quarantine and monitor for symptoms.
In Chapel Hill, sick Tar Heels were isolated, and UNC quarantined anyone who was exposed when it announced it was sending students home on Aug. 17.
Those who went home were advised to self-isolate for 14 days, according to Ken Pittman, campus health executive director. Contact tracers have been effective in mitigating further spread, he said. Still, the UNC Covid-19 dashboard showed another 26 new cases on Aug. 28.
Out of state
East Carolina reported 370 total positive cases from students as of Aug. 24. ECU's contact tracing coordinator, Kelli Russell, said although they've run into issues with voice mailboxes that are full or not set up, students are answering their phones and speaking with the trained contact tracers, and have been transparent about where they have been and whom they have been in contact with.
UNC's staff and student health services work with county officials to locate cases on campus or nearby and traces close contacts of students testing positive even if they've left campus, Pittman said. They'll coordinate with local health departments when a close contact who isn't a student is identified, even out of state.

(AP) — Hundreds are quarantined at several Kansas universities as a growing number of students test positive for the coronavirus, raising concerns that they could bring the virus home with them over the upcoming holiday weekend.
At Pittsburg State University, 96 positive COVID-19 cases have been recorded among students since the fall semester began Aug. 17, officials said during a media briefing Wednesday. Currently, 101 people are in isolation, or separated from people who are not sick, and about 600 are in quarantine, or separated for the monitoring of the development of symptoms, the Joplin Globe reports.
Pittsburg State officials are “strongly suggesting” that students remain in Pittsburg over the coming Labor Day weekend.
“We feel we have a good handle on the situation here,” Tim Stebbins, the public health officer in Crawford County, where Pittsburg is located. “We don’t need the virus coming in and out due to student travel.”
At Emporia State University, officials announced Wednesday that all athletic activities were temporarily suspended. The school said in a news release that total of 14 student-athletes out of more than 400 spread across all teams had tested positive for COVID-19.
The University of Kansas announced Wednesday that the number of positive cases resulting from compulsory testing of students arriving on campus had grown to 546, for a 2.42% overall positivity rate, according to a news release. Among fraternities and sororities, the percentage testing positive shrank from 10% to 8.38% as the houses added freshmen members who had lower rates of infection to their ranks. Nine Greek houses were places on quarantine last week.
At Benedictine College in Atchison, health officials in the county want to put all of the school's 2,000 students in quarantine for 14 days. Under the plan, students would only leave their residential quarters to obtain packed meals from the cafeteria and participate in religious services, the St. Joseph News-Press reports.
Currently, 16 students are in isolation in the community after testing positive and 132 are in quarantine as a precaution because they may have been exposed, said college spokesman Steve Johnson. He said the school thinks it has adequate mitigation in place and quarantining all students is “not the best solution."" No final decision has been made.
Statewide, Kansas reported 1,328 new COVID-19 cases from Monday to Wednesday, bringing the state’s confirmed total to 43,940. That includes 15 sports clusters with 119 cases. Health officials also reported an additional 12 COVID-19-related deaths for a statewide death toll of 458.
One of the deadliest outbreaks was at Riverbend Post Acute Rehabilitation in Wyandotte County, where 37 residents died, KCUR reports. A newly released scathing federal report said that weeks into the outbreak, inspectors still saw health workers caring for COVID-19 patients without proper protective gear.
Riverbend argued a federal law shields it against 12 lawsuits that have been filed, but a federal judge rejected the argument two weeks ago.
“This report just confirms the allegations we’ve already made,” said Rachel Stahle, a lawyer representing families in seven of the lawsuits."

The school found elevated amounts of Covid-19 in wastewater samples collected from four residence halls on campus.
Officials issued a safety alert on Sunday calling for mandatory testing and quarantine of all 287 students living in Rich, Jones, Morgan and Davis on-campus residence halls.
Classes started Monday at the school and some of the students had just moved into their rooms.
The mandatory quarantine is effective immediately and will continue until the test results are returned. USU also activated a Covid care team to arrange for resources to assist the affected students, including meal deliveries.
Wastewater sampling began July 1 and provides an early alert warning to address potential cases, said Amanda DeRito, a director with the university.
""The benefit of testing the water is that we get a snapshot into what is happening on campus and can quarantine even before a student becomes symptomatic. It is also less invasive,"" DeRito said.
No other testing samples on campus taken this week show elevated levels of the virus and there are currently no reported positive tests for Covid-19 in the quarantined residence halls, according to a university press release.
In mid-August, the CDC announced creation of the National Wastewater Surveillance System to help local public health leaders better understand the extent of the spread of the pandemic in their communities.
Sewage from house and workplaces can be tested for genetic material from the novel coronavirus. Studies show the virus can be found in feces from people who are sick and also from people who don't yet have Covid-19 symptoms.
Testing for all Americans a 'utopian' idea, administration official says
Adm. Brett Giroir, the Trump administration's coronavirus testing czar, on Tuesday dismissed the idea of daily Covid-19 tests for all Americans as ""utopian.""
""It's great to talk about this utopian kind of idea where everybody has a test every day and we can do that,"" Giroir said. ""I don't live in a utopian world. I live in the real world, and the real world had no tests for this new disease when this first started.""
The assistant secretary for health at the US Department of Health and Human Services said that the country now has a ""huge diversity"" of tests, including a $5 point of care test that provides results within 15 minutes.
""There is no stone unturned, there is no technology that we're not looking at or investing in if it's promising,"" Giroir said. ""We can return to society without having everyone have a test every single day. We can do that. We're showing we can do that.
""There may be a time where everybody can wake up in the morning, pass through a tricorder and tell whether they're infected or not,"" Giroir said, referring to the fictional handheld device from ""Star Trek"" that could scan people for data. ""We are not there yet.""
Testing availability and speed has improved in the US, particularly since the disastrous spring delays. Giroir said 91.9% of results from major referral labs, which do about half the tests in the US, were completed in three days. The mean turnaround time in August for large referral labs was 2.27 days.
Still, that 2.27-day average delay allows the virus to quietly spread, and public health and lab industry experts have repeatedly called on the federal government to take a larger leadership role in coordinating testing supplies.
US Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, the House majority whip, responded to Giroir's comments by saying, ""It would not be utopian if we had a national program to combat this pandemic. It may be going state by state. But one national program would not be utopian at all.""
CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen indicated that Giroir was attacking a straw man. Testing is an important part of public health strategy, but no one seriously argues testing can solve everything alone.
""He says, 'People say we can test our way out of the pandemic.' I have never heard anyone seriously say that,"" Cohen said. ""He needs to stop making up these boogie men who he's fighting against. No one is telling him we need a utopia. We're just telling him he needs to do better.""
Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, noted on Twitter that the White House staff has widespread testing, as do sports leagues such as the NFL.
""It's not utopia to want to test teachers & kids to return to school, nursing home residents to stay alive, first responders and other essential workers,"" he wrote. ""Sure, lets call it utopia when it's for the less privileged.""
Dire warnings for Iowa
A White House coronavirus task force report sent to officials in the state of Iowa this week warned of dire new case increases across rural and urban areas and called for a mask mandate, the closure of bars, and for university towns to do more as the pandemic intensifies in the Midwest.
CNN has obtained the nine-page August 30 report for the state, first reported by the Des Moines Register, from the Iowa Department of Public Health. The task force releases state-by-state reports each week to governors' offices, and has so far declined to make them publicly available.
The report says that Iowa is in the task force-defined ""red zone"" and warns that the state has the highest rate of cases in the US, which increased by 77.4% from the previous week.
Campus outbreaks
In the report, the task force points to universities as a major factor contributing to the virus's spread.
The three counties with the highest numbers of cases also have large student populations: Story County, home to Iowa State, and Johnson County, home to University of Iowa, as well as Polk County, which contains Iowa's largest metro area, Des Moines.
The university crossed the 1,000 active case mark on August 29 when it reported 302 cases in a single day. The overall current case load, including employees, is 1,026.
Other schools reported outbreaks.
At the University of South Carolina, 1,017 students currently have Covid-19, according to the university's coronavirus dashboard, making it one of the highest case counts recorded at a college so far.
Despite the climbing active case count and the fact that 60% of the university's designated quarantine space is in use, according to its dashboard, the school still lists its' alert level as ""low.""
The University of Missouri has 424 active student Covid-19 cases, according to the school's Covid-19 dashboard. James Madison University is reporting 138 new Covid-19 positive cases among its students and employees since Monday, according the JMU dashboard.
More than 20,000 cases of Covid-19 among students and staff have been reported at colleges and universities across at least 36 states, according to a CNN tally.
The campus reopenings represent new coronavirus hot spots in a country with plenty enough already as the US surpassed 6 million total confirmed cases on Monday.
NIH rejects plasma treatment
A National Institutes of Health panel said there's no evidence backing the use of convalescent plasma to treat coronavirus patients and that doctors should not treat it as a standard of care until more study has been done.
""There are insufficient data to recommend either for or against the use of convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19,"" the panel of more than three dozen experts said in a statement posted on the NIH website.
The statement, which was posted quietly, contradicts the Trump administration's characterization of the treatment as ""historic"" and a ""major advance"" and directly refers to last week's emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration.
Also Tuesday, an independent committee said any eventual coronavirus vaccine should go first to the people most at risk of catching it.
The draft report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine makes recommendations similar to those that have come from other groups, but it goes into detail to explain why health workers, for instance, should be among the first to get a vaccine."

Englert said Sunday. The college reported 103 active coronavirus cases on Sunday, nearly double the 58 cases it reported on Friday.
“It was kind of insane. We checked today and it went up to 100,” freshman Miranda Ford said. “It definitely makes me a little upset. I had a couple of classes in-person, which is kind of why I’m here. But I’m hoping that over the next two weeks that we are safe and we get better and we are able to resume classes.”
Most of the students who tested positive are asymptomatic and a small number have mild to moderate flu-like symptoms, Englert said. The university said it’s tested more than 5,000 people in the past two weeks.
“Any increase is concerning, though not necessarily alarming. In this instance, we appear to be seeing new cases that result from small social gatherings happening off campus,” Englert said in a letter to the Temple community. “This trend prompted conversations with the Philadelphia Department of Public Health (PDPH) and resulted in the revised guidance issued by PDPH on Saturday.
“The new data also prompted the university’s leadership to implement the flexibility embedded in the comprehensive plans we developed earlier this year. After reviewing this new information, we are instituting a two-week ‘pause’ for in-person classes, and an extensive collaboration with PDPH to test and contact trace student cases and minimize further spread.”
Beginning on Monday, in-person classes will move online through at least Friday, Sept. 11, the university said. Englert said only classes deemed essential by the college will be held in-person during this period, and those students will be notified by their school. Online classes will not be affected.
Englert said the university hopes it can resume with the hybrid model it had in place at the semester’s start but will use this two-week period to assess the situation.
“I definitely did see that going on, I mean, it’s kind of hard to prevent that, there’s only so much you can do,” freshman Ethan Blatz said. “So they can strictly enforce anything, but I don’t think you can really stop kids from being together.”
“I will miss having in-person classes, but if it’s for our safety and whatever, I think they’re doing the right thing,” freshman Taylor Woolford said.
Students who have COVID-19 symptoms are being asked to immediately get tested. Students can contact Student Health Services to make an appointment.
There will be coronavirus testing available between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. on Monday inside the practice facility at the Aramark STAR Complex on Main Campus.

Statewide, Kansas reported 1,328 new COVID-19 cases from Monday to Wednesday, bringing the state’s confirmed total to 43,940. That includes 15 sports clusters with 119 cases. Health officials also reported an additional 12 COVID-19-related deaths for a statewide death toll of 458.
One of the deadliest outbreaks was at Riverbend Post Acute Rehabilitation in Wyandotte County, where 37 residents died, KCUR reports. A newly released scathing federal report said that weeks into the outbreak, inspectors still saw health workers caring for COVID-19 patients without proper protective gear.
Riverbend argued a federal law shields it against 12 lawsuits that have been filed, but a federal judge rejected the argument two weeks ago.

Due to a potential COVID-19 exposure, Holy Family moved all classes at its Northeast Philly campus online. A brief health advisory posted to the university's website did not specify how long the campus would remain closed.
The Newtown, Bucks County campus, residence halls and Tiger Café remain open.
Faculty and staff have been encouraged to work remotely. University officials said they will provide more information as it becomes available.
Holy Family is among various local colleges that have attempted to resume in-person instruction, but it hasn't been a coronavirus-free transition.
Temple University called off in-person classes through at least Sept. 11 after more than 100 students tested positive for COVID-19. Temple officials believe the recent spike is tied to off-campus social gatherings.
Villanova University threatened to send students home if they failed to meet health protocols after an impromptu gathering of hundreds of students.
Elsewhere in Pennsylvania, Bloomsburg and Lock Haven universities also reverted to remote learning.
Holy Family had permitted classes of 24 students or less to meet in person, with social distancing protocols in place. Courses with more than 25 students were split into two halves that alternated between remote and in-person instruction on a weekly basis.
Students and faculty are required to wear face masks at all times on campus, except when eating or drinking. They are asked to stay six feet apart and screen themselves for COVID-19 symptoms.
Holy Family officials made a significant investment in classroom technology prior to the semester to allow for remote learning and prepare for a possible outbreak, officials said."

Temple says it now has 127 positive cases among students, but testing is still underway and results on hundreds of tests are still pending.
Many of the Temple University students infected with COVID-19 live in off-campus housing, which poses a substantial threat of community spread, according to the Philadelphia Health Department, which is tracking a sudden spike in cases at the university.
“Overall, these numbers are concerning and the rate of rise is even more concerning. There clearly is an outbreak occurring among Temple students,” Philadelphia Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas Farley said.
The campus was only open for a week when coronavirus cases doubled, prompting the university to pause in-person classes and switch to all virtual.
The student infections are linked to housing and small social get-togethers.
The health commissioner is now recommending against all gatherings with this pointed warning to Temple students.
“You should assume that everyone around you is infected, stay in your room,” Farley said. “Otherwise, this outbreak could grow quickly and could threaten the rest of the campus and the rest of the city.”
The health department also issued a new policy prohibiting competition for high-risk youth and high school contact sports.
While teams cannot play, they can practice if social distancing precautions are followed.
“Such as tackle football, soccer, rugby and indoor basketball,” Dr. Farley said.
The city will allow competition for lower-risk sports like baseball, crew and track and field.
“There are exceptions for professional and collegiate teams if their safety protocols are specially approved by the health department,” Farley said.
Dr. Farley says except for Temple University sports.
Overall the case counts continue to decline, but safety precautions of masks and social distancing are still critically important.
“The virus has the potential to come back strong at any time,” Farley said.
Farley says retail surveillance indicates about 90% of people on the streets of Philadelphia are wearing masks and that the city is still on track to allow limited indoor dining and theaters to reopen on Sept. 8."

“We feel we have a good handle on the situation here,” Tim Stebbins, the public health officer in Crawford County, where Pittsburg is located. “We don’t need the virus coming in and out due to student travel.”
At Emporia State University, officials announced Wednesday that all athletic activities were temporarily suspended. The school said in a news release that total of 14 student-athletes out of more than 400 spread across all teams had tested positive for COVID-19.
The University of Kansas announced Wednesday that the number of positive cases resulting from compulsory testing of students arriving on campus had grown to 546, for a 2.42% overall positivity rate, according to a news release.
At Benedictine College in Atchison, health officials in the county want to put all of the school’s 2,000 students in quarantine for 14 days.

The university said on Twitter that positive tests for coronavirus were exceeding 50% in some Greek houses, higher than in dorms, and told fraternity and sorority members to “re-evaluate their current living situation.”
“Based on an increasingly alarming rate of positive test results from continued COVID-19 mitigation testing, IU Bloomington and its public health experts believe Greek houses are not safe given the pandemic conditions,” the school tweeted.
Indiana University, a campus of some 40,000 students, said it lacked the authority to manage the privately owned houses, but hoped Greek organizations and landlords would work with students to help them make new arrangements.
Some students responding on social media accused the school of unfairly blaming the Greek system. Others said administrators should have expected outbreaks where a number of people were living in close quarters.
Major universities have grappled with thousands of students returning to campus for the fall semester, with some imposing online-only learning. New cases have spiked at some colleges that have allowed students to return to class.
HOLLYWOOD STAR TESTS POSITIVE
New coronavirus infections have fallen nationwide for six weeks in a row but surged in the Midwest. Iowa, North Dakota and South Dakota are reporting the highest percentage of positive tests, over 20% in each state.
Hundreds of thousands of motorcyclists descended on Sturgis, South Dakota, in August for an annual rally and health experts feared that could further spread the virus. On Wednesday a Minnesota health official said a motorcycle enthusiast in his 60s who had shown up there died of COVID-19.
New cases rose 27% last week in Minnesota and 34% in Indiana.
Among those who have tested positive in recent days are British actor Robert Pattinson, 35, bringing an abrupt halt to production of his film “The Batman” as Hollywood struggles to regain its footing following a pandemic shutdown.
The Baseball Hall of Fame said late on Wednesday that Tom Seaver, considered one of the sport’s greatest right-handed pitchers, had died of complications of COVID-19 and Lewy body dementia at the age of 75.
And pro-wrestler turned Hollywood actor Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, 48, said in a video message posted on social media on Wednesday that he, his wife and their two children had tested positive for COVID-19 in recent weeks but had since recovered
New York City on Thursday allowed malls to reopen their doors to shoppers at 50% capacity. Statewide, casinos can now operate at 25% capacity.
“Thanks to the hard work of New Yorkers, we are at a point in our fight against this virus where we can safely reopen malls in New York City as long as they adhere to strict health and safety protocols,” Governor Andrew Cuomo said.
New York has seen by far the most COVID-19 deaths of any U.S. state, with more than 32,000, but its rate of new infections has dropped to among the lowest in the nation.
At least 185,754 have died of the illness across the United States, according to a Reuters tally.
U.S. public health officials and Pfizer Inc PFE.N said a COVID-19 vaccine could be ready for distribution as soon as late October, just ahead of the Nov. 3 election in which the pandemic is likely to be a major factor in whether President Donald Trump wins a second term.

A return to campus for the new academic year has colleges and universities struggling to both contain outbreaks of COVID-19 and enforce policies meant to prevent its spread.
Across the United States, at least 36 states have reported positive cases at colleges and universities, adding more than 8,700 cases to the country's overall tally.
More than 5.9 million infections have been recorded in the United States, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Since classes started on Aug. 19, 1,200 students at the University of Alabama have tested positive for the virus, the university system's website showed Saturday. Classes at the University of Dayton will continue online for at least two weeks after the school reported 116 cases on Thursday and then another 148 on Friday, according to the university's website.
Outbreaks have been identified at four different sororities at Kansas State University, according to news releases from the college and the Riley County Health Department.
Providence College in Rhode Island has implemented policies to prevent the virus' spread, but 17 students have been placed on ""interim suspension"" for violating those measures, meaning they will not be allowed on campus or in classes until they attend a hearing, college spokesperson Steven Maurano told CNN Saturday.
""I am deeply disappointed by the selfish behavior of these students who defiantly chose to ignore our COVID-19 Code of Conduct,"" Fr. Kenneth R. Sicard, O.P., the college's president, said in a statement. ""While I find no joy in having to endorse such strong sanctions, I know they are necessary if we are going to have a successful fall semester.""

In this week's modeling data, the number of repopulating college towns that have heightened risk for widespread community transmission far outnumber the few campuses that appear to be conferring no new risk to their communities. This is especially notable in regions that reported high case counts before students arrived again, such as the South and Midwest, where the reopening of colleges and some K-12 schools has quickly accelerated the risk for widespread transmission and increasing test positivity rates in the coming weeks. The increasing risk is particularly of concern for smaller college towns—such as Morgantown, W.Va., State College, Pa., and Bloomington, Ind.—that have already seen campus outbreaks. Furthermore, more than two weeks into the new semester, test positivity rates remain over 10% in Iowa City, Tuscaloosa, Ala., and Boone, Mo.
The researchers are watching very closely for impacts across Minnesota, which is seeing some of the highest risk in the PolicyLab model, as the state forges ahead with reopening K-12 schools and colleges simultaneously, while being located in a part of the country that sees some of the earliest arrival of colder weather. Finally, data validity concerns in Mississippi and Texas, and growing risk for virus resurgence in parts of Tennessee, South Carolina, and North Carolina, are reasons to closely monitor forecasts in the South over the next few weeks.
Aside from the challenges that school reopenings are bringing to communities, the forecasting model projects that case counts will likely continue to decline over the next four weeks in many major metropolitan areas across California, including San Diego and San Francisco, and Florida, including Miami and Orlando. The researchers also observed some stabilization in parts of New England—such as Boston and Providence—and modest improvements in projections for Baltimore and other parts of Maryland, as forecasted risk declines in coastal counties. The forecasts for these northern areas, as well those for Denver, Seattle and its neighboring communities in the Pacific Northwest, are becoming more favorable for safely reopening schools for in-person learning, as per PolicyLab's school reopening guidance and recommended test positivity and case incidence thresholds, assuming college openings do not add new risk.
""While we feel relieved to see improving forecasts for much of California and Florida, and some stabilization in the Northeast, the challenging situation in the Midwest and Heartland has us very concerned for the health and safety of those communities in the weeks ahead,"" said David Rubin, MD, MSCE, director of PolicyLab at CHOP and a professor of Pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine. ""We know clearly now that, despite best efforts, college reopenings have not been going well in areas of high transmission. Although the virus is spreading among younger, often healthier adults, we are mindful that these students don't live in a bubble. Monitoring emergency department and hospital visit rates in these communities over the next 2-3 weeks will be informative as to the sustainability of these outbreaks.""

Background
Researchers at PolicyLab at CHOP and the University of Pennsylvania developed the model, known as COVID-Lab: Mapping COVID-19 in Your Community, which tracks COVID-19 transmission and test positivity rates across all U.S. counties, and projects case counts for 817 counties with active outbreaks, representing 82% of the U.S. population and 88% of all identified coronavirus cases. The researchers built their model to observe how social distancing, population density, daily temperatures, and humidity affect the number and spread of COVID-19 infections over time across a county, accounting for test positivity rates and population characteristics such as age, insurance status, crowding within homes and diabetes prevalence. COVID-Lab's projections forecast the number of coronavirus cases communities could experience over the next four weeks based on a three-day average of their current social distancing practices, defined by the change in travel to non-essential businesses as compared to pre-epidemic. This is just one tool in a toolbox of resources policymakers and decision-makers can use as they manage their COVID-19 response efforts.
The application of this model, which focuses on time-varying transmission rates during the early months of the pandemic in the U.S., was released on July 23, following peer review, in JAMA Network Open. You can read more about how the team validates their models for accuracy in this blog post. The data are publicly available in the form of interactive maps and graphs.

A return to campus for the new academic year has colleges and universities struggling to both contain outbreaks of COVID-19 and enforce policies meant to prevent its spread.
Across the United States, at least 36 states have reported positive cases at colleges and universities, adding more than 8,700 cases to the country's overall tally.
More than 5.9 million infections have been recorded in the United States, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Since classes started on Aug. 19, 1,200 students at the University of Alabama have tested positive for the virus, the university system's website showed Saturday. Classes at the University of Dayton will continue online for at least two weeks after the school reported 116 cases on Thursday and then another 148 on Friday, according to the university's website.
Outbreaks have been identified at four different sororities at Kansas State University, according to news releases from the college and the Riley County Health Department.
Providence College in Rhode Island has implemented policies to prevent the virus' spread, but 17 students have been placed on ""interim suspension"" for violating those measures, meaning they will not be allowed on campus or in classes until they attend a hearing, college spokesperson Steven Maurano told CNN Saturday.
""I am deeply disappointed by the selfish behavior of these students who defiantly chose to ignore our COVID-19 Code of Conduct,"" Fr. Kenneth R. Sicard, O.P., the college's president, said in a statement. ""While I find no joy in having to endorse such strong sanctions, I know they are necessary if we are going to have a successful fall semester.""
Over 1,000 students have tested positive for COVID-19 at University of Alabama since classes resumed"

A Gloucester County town held a virtual public meeting Wednesday to address concerns about spiking numbers of COVID-19 cases, which have nearly doubled since a university here started classes on Sept. 1.
Glassboro ranked 10th in the county with 216 coronavirus cases before classes began at Rowan University and now ranks 4th with 425, a township official said during the meeting.
Rowan has 4,088 students on campus living in dormitories, most of whom have a roommate. The university is at 63% occupancy.
It has more students on campus than any other college in the state. By comparison, Rutgers University, has had 101 cases since May 30. That’s in more than three months versus the two-week span during which Rowan cases have spiked. But Rutgers has 1,875 students living on campus. It typically houses 19,000.
Rowan has had 154 active cases of COVID-19 since Aug. 25, a school officials said Wednesday during the virtual meeting. Before the meeting, a school website listed 145 active case, including 100 involving students who live off campus.
Most of the questions during the meeting were submitted ahead of time and read by Edward Malandro, the township administrator, to a panel of university and municipal officials. Questions mostly centered on who gave permission for the students to return and how are they now being supervised.
“We all understand the frustrations you have and on their face the solutions may be simple,” said Jack Manning, the local emergency management coordinator and a township police detective. “But...they’re not very simple.”
Manning said Rowan appears to be operating within state guidelines for reopening colleges. The state did not set an occupancy guideline for college dormitories. It just said they can’t be at 100%.
University and municipal officials presented a united front. Both said communications between them have never been better and both sides are working to maintain a safe environment.
“Rowan is part of Glassboro and Glassboro is our home,” said Tony Lowman, the university provost. “We want to be a good neighbor.”
University officials said they monitor the health and safety of students and the community daily. They said students who have caught the virus are isolated in a specific dorm on campus until they recover and most have had mild symptoms.
But residents pressed for more answers.
“With large outbreaks at nearby schools like Temple, why did you feel like bringing kids back to school was the right decision?” Malandro asked the panel, reading a submitted question.
“We’re comfortable in our plan,” Lowman said. “We rely on the data available to us and we work very closely with the state and public health officials to develop this plan.”
Lowman said 80% of class instruction is remote and only about 20% is in person. He and other officials said they are actively engaged with students on and off campus to behave responsibly and university officials and local police have disbanded crowded gatherings.
Rowan is one of about a dozen colleges in New Jersey voluntarily sharing COVID-19 figures publicly. The action is not required by the Office of the Secretary of Higher Education’s 27-page document of standards for colleges to resume, called “The Road Back.”
No other reporting college has nearly the number of cases Rowan has had in such a short time period, though reporting standards and intervals vary widely.
University and township officials said they plan to continue having virtual meetings to update the public about the spread of virus and what is being done to combat it.
Glassboro officials said they have closed parks and municipal facilities and modified employee schedules to minimize exposure.
“While this wasn’t unexpected, it is still unnerving,” Manning said.

101,https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-09-lack-covid-resources-millions-somalia.html,-1.0,Lack of COVID-19 resources risking millions in Somalia settlement camps,"A lack of access to screening services and important information about COVID-19—including all of the ways the highly-infectious virus can be transmitted—could be putting millions of internally displaced people in Somali settlement camps at risk, according to new research by the Yale School of Public Health and The Hagarla Institute.
Three million internally displaced people (IDP) live in more than 2,000 settlement camps in Somalia. The large-scale camps are a tinderbox for potential outbreaks of infectious disease. Overcrowded conditions restrict opportunities for physical distancing and the camps often lack reliable access to basic amenities such as running water, soap, and medical treatment. The situation is exacerbated by Somalia's weakened health care infrastructure, which has been fractured by natural disasters and 30 years of civil war.
The humanitarian crisis is already acute. Somalia has some of the lowest health indicators in the world with life expectancies of 54 years for males and 57 years for females. Somalia ranks 194 out of 195 countries in preparedness for a globally catastrophic biological event such as a disease outbreak, according to the Global Health Security Index. In a broader sense, the conditions identified in Somalia's IDP camps may be an indicator of similar situations within other IDP and refugee camps around the world, where more than 60 million people currently reside.
What Can Be Done to Help?
""A massive influx of resources and targeted interventions is needed to protect the millions of people living in these camps from COVID-19, starting with educating those most vulnerable to infection,"" said Yale School of Public Health Associate Professor Kaveh Khoshnood, Ph.D., the study's senior author. ""We hope this study serves as an incentive for international organizations operating within Somalia, as well as the Somalia government, to expand their investments in a sustainable health care infrastructure, not only to address COVID-19, but to improve the long-term health and prosperity of the population.""
Somalia has been fortunate in that the country of 15 million people has reported only 3,371 cases and 97 deaths associated with COVID-19 as of Sept. 13. But health officials remain concerned about a virus outbreak in the camps, given conditions there and the lack of access to adequate prevention resources and medical care.
Recognizing the immediate health threat posed by the coronavirus, a Yale School of Public Health research team led by Khoshnood partnered with doctors and clinicians from The Hagarla Institute in Mogadishu, Somalia to conduct a scientific survey of people living in the IDP camps regarding COVID-19. The investigators wanted to gage people's knowledge and perceptions about COVID-19 and whether individuals were experiencing symptoms of COVID-19. The study also sought to identify pre-existing health conditions within the IDP camp populations that might be exacerbated by COVID-19 and to what extent preventive measures and medical treatment are available. The survey was the first of its kind undertaken in the Somali camps and is believed to be only the second such study to document knowledge of COVID-19, symptoms and risk factors among displaced populations globally.
While 77% of respondents took at least one precaution to avoid COVID-19 (such as frequent hand washing), all reported a lack of adequate sanitation in the camps, an inability to physically distance and a nearly universal inability to get tested for COVID-19 due to a lack of available resources. When asked about specific COVID-19 prevention and treatment options, about half the time respondents expressed no knowledge of them. The majority of respondents were not familiar with basic information about the virus, including the fact that SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic. A high number of respondents also reported at least one potential symptom of COVID-19 such as headache, cough, fever, etc. although no official diagnosis was undertaken or confirmed. Residents said they trust local radio news reports and religious leaders the most when it comes to getting reliable information about COVID-19.
The study would not have been possible without the expertise and staff resources provided by The Hagarla Institute, a non-profit organization dedicated to clinical research and enhancing health care in Somalia. The Institute operates in the Lower Shabelle region of Somalia, which is considered to be the IDP camp capital of the world. The Institute was founded by former Yale World Fellow Dr. Deqo Mohamed, who is a co-author on the paper. Also listed as a co-author is Dr. Mohamed Abdullahi Awale, a consultant surgeon and senior lecturer at SIMAD University in Mogadishu. Drs. Mohamed and Awale and staff at The Hargarla Institute oversaw and conducted in-person surveys of 401 individuals living in 12 IDP camp across the Lower Shabelle region. A team of YSPH graduate and undergraduate students designed the study and analyzed the data remotely from the United States due to existing COVID-19 restrictions. Khoshnood said the students did a tremendous job pulling the report together under difficult circumstances and a tight deadline.
""It is already difficult to navigate instability in Somalia, but amidst lockdown measures, misinformation, and fear spreading through the community, these circumstances have only been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Jude Alawa, the study's lead author. Alawa, currently a Knight-Hennessy Scholar and first-year medical student at Stanford University, was a Yale Fox Fellow at the time the study was done. He graduated from Yale College as a Global Health Scholar in 2019.
""Our team was incredibly fortunate to be able to collaborate with Drs. Mohamed and Awale and their dedicated colleagues, who worked tirelessly traveling to the IDP camps and addressing the unique challenges we encountered conducting the study,"" said Alawa.
An Added Benefit and Global Perspective: Because the study also gathered basic demographic and health information from camp residents, local health officials now have a better sense of some of the pre-existing health conditions people are dealing with in the IDP camps. Such a comprehensive survey had never been done before.
""Reporting on pre-existing conditions may seem like the last thing on health professionals' minds in the midst of a pandemic, but these are vital statistics that may determine an inflection point in these individuals' health for years to come,"" said YSPH student Lucas Walz, MPH '21, a co-author of the study. ""Even during an infectious pandemic, access to health care and continuing treatment for chronic conditions must be maintained.""
Meeting the health care needs of displaced populations also strengthens the health of the community at large, both locally and globally, said Alawa.
""The COVID-19 pandemic can affect anyone and any response to address this pandemic must necessarily include all individuals, including those displaced,"" said Alawa. ""An inadequate response to COVID-19 in Somalia is likely to threaten global health security and exacerbate the spread of the virus among both displaced and host communities.""

102,https://www.npr.org/2020/09/17/914046958/students-accused-of-breaking-college-covid-19-rules-fight-their-punishments,-1.672,Students Accused Of Breaking College COVID-19 Rules Fight Their Punishments,"As colleges around the U.S. are facing COVID-19 outbreaks and crackdowns on students engaged in coronavirus-risky behavior, campuses are also facing a new threat: legal challenges from the students they're punishing.
Some are brazenly breaking rules, like the hundreds of Syracuse University students who risked everyone's safety — and everyone's semester — by partying like it's not 2020 in late August. Twenty-three students at that party got interim suspensions and were kicked off campus for what Syracuse officials described as ""incredibly reckless behavior.""
The same thing is happening to students at smaller, more ""chill"" gatherings. At Northeastern University, 11 students were caught hanging out together in one room, in violation of bans on having guests in campus housing and on participating in crowded gatherings.
""I was just, like, come on — that's really irresponsible and selfish,"" junior Avery Collard said about the students who were all kicked off campus and out of their program for the semester. Collard said they had it coming.
""There's very specific rules that say you can't do that,"" she said. ""[They're] adults. I know it's hard, but act like it!""
But for all the scorn directed at students who flout the rules, the colleges meting out the discipline are taking heat as well. Rhyia Bibby, a junior at Northeastern, is one of many on campus who think the university went too far by also refusing to refund the students' tuition, which amounts to $36,500 per person.
""I think there are other ways to send a message than to take $36,000 away from incoming students,"" Bibby said. ""I also think it's important that in freshman year, a bit of grace can be given.""
Attorney Brett Joshpe, who appealed the suspension for two of the students, agrees.
""This is just a spiteful, gratuitous, grossly disproportionate penalty,"" he said, for students who were ""just watching a basketball game with friends, with masks on.""
Northeastern refused to budge on the suspensions but on Thursday notified the students that part of the money they lost could be applied to future tuition, if the students choose to return. University officials declined to comment on the case beyond their initial written statement saying that the students were repeatedly warned of the rules and the consequences. Joshpe called the university's response ""totally unacceptable"" and said his clients will be ""evaluating all options.""
Northeastern is hardly the only school whose tough disciplinary actions are under scrutiny. Attorneys say their phones haven't stopped ringing, and they've been hired to help students fight sanctions at other schools, from Syracuse University to New York University, Boston College, Penn State and many more.
""This has gone from a few cases here and there to a near epidemic,"" said attorney Andrew Miltenberg. He has long represented students accused of sexual assault, making the case that those alleged sexual predators were victims of a rush to judgment. Now, he says, schools are doing the same thing to alleged superspreaders.
""They're not allowing any discussion or any mitigating circumstances. People are being summarily suspended, and there is no due process,"" Miltenberg said.
""Schools are taking a suspend first, expel first, and ask questions later stance,"" said Will Creeley, senior vice president of legal and public advocacy with the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a civil rights advocacy group. Creeley said he's also getting multiple calls a day.
""We wonder if in a desire to continue collecting full tuition here, the students are set up to be the fall people here and they're being held to an impossible standard,"" he said.
For their part, schools insist that students do get due process — it just sometimes comes after the fact.
""These are different times, and we've got to make some emergency decisions based upon the facts available so that we can make sure other students are not at risk,"" said Kenneth Elmore, associate provost and dean of students at Boston University. Two groups of students recently got ""deferred suspensions"" for gatherings in dorm rooms, which is a kind of probation that puts them ""one more bad act away"" from being automatically kicked out, Elmore said. Those cases are still under review, but Elmore said, ""That's pretty serious from our standpoint.""
""For us, having six to eight people in less than 200 square feet is highly problematic,"" Elmore said. ""And especially if those folks aren't face-covering. Sometimes people are going to make bad judgments, and we're going to have to, in those cases, be unforgiving.""
But defense attorneys say investigations after the fact are often too late. In many cases, Miltenberg said, the damage is already done to students and their reputations, especially those students suspended for more questionable violations.
For example, Miltenberg said, he is representing one student who was suspended after he walked into his dorm's bathroom, not realizing that he was the seventh guy there and that he was putting the bathroom space one man over capacity. It was an accident, Miltenberg said; should students be expected to peek under the stalls and count feet?
""Students are truly bewildered. Can you take a shower? Can you use the toilet? It's all very vague,"" he said.
Boston University's Elmore concedes that making the call in certain cases can be difficult and that colleges are still figuring things out, just as students are. By nature, Elmore said, he's more the ""moral suasion"" type than a ""drop the hammer"" kind of guy. But, these are not normal times.
""I mean, personally this is really difficult for me,"" he said. ""And I know it sounds weird coming from the person who is the apparent executioner, but we've got to do it. It's a way to say: No, we are serious about this.""
But Elmore agrees that as schools become COVID-19 cops, they need to be extra-careful. With complaints already piling up about unduly harsh punishments, there are also concerns about uneven enforcement.
Darnell Cole, associate professor of higher education, administration and educational psychology at the University of Southern California, is recommending that schools closely monitor demographic data on their COVID-19 discipline cases.
""Those biases that exist external to the institution also exist within the institution, whether intended or not,"" said Cole. ""I think we just know that, and we have to make sure we have equitable treatment that isn't racially discriminatory or biased or sexist."""
103,https://www.denverpost.com/2020/09/18/covid-model-colorado-cases-increase/,0.644,New model projects manageable increase in Colorado’s COVID-19 cases — so long as people keep up precautions,"38
A new report modeling the spread of COVID-19 in Colorado suggests the state could continue to see more cases in the short term, but they’re not likely to reach unmanageable levels unless people further relax their precautions.
The model, from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and the Colorado School of Public Health, attempts to gauge how much social distancing the public is practicing, how many people are currently contagious and how many others they’re likely to spread the virus to.
If most people continue behaving roughly as they do now, cases are projected to increase over the next two months, but not get out of control. If significant numbers of Coloradans stop taking precautions, it’s possible there could be more intensive care patients than beds in the winter or spring.
“It looks like we’re in a place where things are stable or very slowly increasing,” said Beth Carlton, an associate professor of environmental and occupational health at the Colorado School of Public Health.
The number of people who are currently infected is relatively low at this point, which decreases the odds that any particular person has the virus and could give it to you, Carlton said. But it’s still important to wear masks and avoid crowded, poorly ventilated spaces, she said, because the more people you encounter under conditions where the virus spreads easily, the less the numbers work in your favor.
Models lay out possible scenarios based on certain conditions continuing. They haven’t been as successful in predicting the course of this pandemic as they are with some diseases because people have tended to change their behavior more drastically than usual, buckling down as cases rise and reducing their precautions when they start to fall again.
As schools reopen and other parts of life return to normal, the average person will have more close contacts, Carlton said. What’s unknown is how many of those contacts will be high risk, she said.
“Now we know there are ways to interact with people that are lower risk,” she said.
Another models suggest a similar trajectory, at least in the short term.
Projections from Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia’s PolicyLab showed cases stabilizing or slightly increasing over the next two weeks in 14 Colorado counties. The model attempts to account for changing weather, along with levels of social distancing, because respiratory viruses spread more easily in the cold, said Dr. David Rubin, director of PolicyLab.
Even areas of Colorado that have seen an increase in cases, like Boulder County, don’t look too bad at this point, Rubin said. Boulder County’s positivity rate has remained low compared to some university communities, and that indicates that the University of Colorado Boulder and local health officials may be succeeding in keeping the virus contained in the student population, he said.
“They’re not out of the woods, but there’s not a clear indication things are getting worse,” he said."
104,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/17/world/covid-19-coronavirus.html,-1.044,A much-criticized testing recommendation on the C.D.C.’s website last month was not written by C.D.C. scientists.,"[Read our live Covid-19/Coronavirus global updates.]
A much-criticized testing recommendation on the C.D.C.’s website last month was not written by C.D.C. scientists.
A heavily criticized recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last month about who should be tested for the coronavirus was not written by C.D.C. scientists and was posted to the agency’s website despite their serious objections, according to several people familiar with the matter as well as internal documents obtained by The New York Times.
The guidance said it was not necessary to test people without symptoms of Covid-19 even if they had been exposed to the virus. It came at a time when public health experts were pushing for more testing rather than less, and administration officials told The Times that the document was a C.D.C. product and had been revised with input from the agency’s director, Dr. Robert R. Redfield.
But officials told The Times this week that the Department of Health and Human Services did the rewriting itself and then “dropped” it into the C.D.C.’s public website, flouting the agency’s strict scientific review process.
“That was a doc that came from the top down, from the H.H.S. and the task force,” said a federal official with knowledge of the matter, referring to the White House task force on the coronavirus. “That policy does not reflect what many people at the C.D.C. feel should be the policy.”
Adm. Brett Giroir, the administration’s testing coordinator and an assistant secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services, the C.D.C.’s parent organization, said in an interview Thursday that the original draft came from the C.D.C., but he “coordinated editing and input from the scientific and medical members of the task force.”
Over a period of a month, he said, the draft went through about 20 versions, with comments from Dr. Redfield; top members of the White House task force, Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx; and Dr. Scott Atlas, President Trump’s adviser on the coronavirus. The members also presented the document to Vice President Mike Pence, who heads the task force, Admiral Giroir said.
C.D.C. staff scientists’ objections to the pre-published document went unheard. A senior C.D.C. official told the scientists, “We do not have the ability to make substantial edits,” according to an email obtained by The Times.
Similarly, a document, arguing for “the importance of reopening schools,” was also dropped into the C.D.C. website by the Department of Health and Human Services in July and is sharply out of step with the C.D.C.’s usual neutral and scientific tone, the officials said.
Joe Biden tries to focus the presidential campaign on Trump’s virus response.
Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. sought on Thursday to focus the presidential campaign on President Trump’s handling of the coronavirus.
Appearing on CNN at a town hall-style event less than two weeks before the first presidential debate, Mr. Biden cast the president as a callous leader and chided Attorney General William P. Barr for suggesting that local stay-at-home mandates are the greatest threat to individual freedoms since slavery.
“What takes away your freedom is not being able to see your kid, not being able to go to the football game or baseball game, not being able to see your mom or dad sick in the hospital, not being able to do the things, that’s what is costing us our freedom,” Mr. Biden said. “And it’s been the failure of this president to deal, to deal with this virus, and he knew about it.”
At other turns, Mr. Biden pointed to revelations from a new book by the journalist Bob Woodward that the president knowingly minimized the risks of the coronavirus, and added to his earlier warnings that Mr. Trump has politicized the rollout of a vaccine.
“I don’t trust the president on vaccines,” Mr. Biden said at the town hall near his childhood home of Scranton, Pa., as audience members listened from their cars. “I trust Dr. Fauci. If Fauci says a vaccine is safe, I’d take the vaccine.”
Mr. Biden also said that he could not enforce a national mask mandate everywhere, breaking with a position he had taken a day earlier. But he asserted that he would have the authority to do so “on federal land.”
Many states require the use of masks and have issued stay-at-home orders to slow the spread of the virus. Earlier this week, Robert R. Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suggested that masks might be more effective in fighting the pandemic than a vaccine — only to have Mr. Trump call his statement a mistake.
Mr. Biden’s appearance, his biggest on a national stage since he accepted the Democratic nomination last month, came on the same night that President Trump announced about $13 billion in assistance to farmers at a campaign rally in the battleground state of Wisconsin.
More than 2,200 new cases were announced in Wisconsin on Thursday, a single-day record, according to a New York Times database, and the state has added more cases in the past week than in any other seven-day stretch of the pandemic. Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin canceled plans to travel to his home state with Mr. Trump and appear at the rally, saying that he would self-isolate for two weeks after coming into contact with an infected person.

Earlier on Thursday, a former Homeland Security aide to Vice President Mike Pence endorsed Mr. Biden and accused President Trump of drastically mismanaging the response to the coronavirus crisis.
The former aide, Olivia Troye, played a central role in running the White House’s coronavirus task force until leaving the government last month. In an online ad, she said she was voting for Mr. Biden because she believed the nation was in a “constitutional crisis” and that “at this point it’s country over party.”
Mr. Pence fired back from the White House.
“I haven’t read her comments in any detail,” he said on Thursday during a meeting of the Coronavirus Commission for Safety and Quality in Nursing Homes. “But it reads to me like one more disgruntled employee that has decided to play politics during an election year.”
GLOBAL ROUNDUP
The global total of reported cases surpasses 30 million.
More than 30 million cases of the coronavirus have been reported worldwide as of Thursday, according to a New York Times database. India, in particular, has recently contributed significantly to the count, having added more than 93,000 new cases a day on average over the last week.
Some of the countries that were hit hard early on have seen a decline in cases, but the number of newly reported infections is growing faster than ever worldwide, as many nations have scaled up their testing efforts. The average of known new cases is now more than 250,000 a day. The world reached 10 million cases on June 28 and 20 million on Aug. 10.
The United States has the world’s highest case count: more than 6.7 million. After that comes India, with more than 5.1 million, and Brazil, with about 4.4 million. But in the past seven days, India has added more than 652,000 cases, more than twice as many as the United States over the same period and almost three times as many as Brazil. Still, India’s per capita number of recent cases remains far below that of the two others.
Nearly 200,000 people have died of the virus in the United States, and 134,000 in Brazil. No other country has recorded 100,000 fatalities related to the virus.
The United States ranks 11th in deaths per capita, behind Brazil and countries such as Peru, Ecuador, Chile, Bolivia, Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom. The virus is currently taking a heavy toll in Latin America, which encompasses eight of the 10 countries with the highest numbers of reported deaths per capita over the past week.
As of Thursday morning, at least 940,100 infected people had died globally, and the virus had been detected in nearly every country.
In other international news:
Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia on Friday raised the cap on international arrivals to 6,000 from 4,000 people a week, after critics accused him of leaving citizens stranded overseas. Approximately 24,000 Australians are currently outside the country, Mr. Morrison said, adding that he hoped many of them would be home by Christmas. The state of Queensland also said on Friday that it would allow flights to resume to and from the Australian Capital Territory next week. Australia has reported 297 new cases in the past week, and its second-largest city, Melbourne, remains under lockdown.
New Zealand recorded no new cases on Friday for the first time in more than a month, after an outbreak in Auckland in August threatened the country’s progress in keeping the virus at bay. Friday was also the fourth consecutive day without any new cases of community transmission, the authorities said. The remote Pacific country has just 70 current active cases. Four of those coronavirus patients have been hospitalized, with one in intensive care.
India recorded 96,424 new cases on Thursday, a day after reporting its highest single-day increase of 97,894. The country’s caseload of 5.1 million is the world’s second-highest, after the United States, according to a New York Times database. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who turned 70 on Thursday, made a fresh appeal for people in the country to wear masks, avoid crowds and practice social distancing.
The number of Hasidic Jewish pilgrims halted by virus travel restrictions along the border between Belarus and Ukraine has increased significantly in recent days, Ukrainian officials said on Thursday. The pileup along the border has become one of the more dramatic consequences of virus travel bans. Ukraine closed its borders last month as cases in the country ticked up, partly to halt the yearly pilgrimage to the city of Uman, the site of the grave of Rabbi Nachman, the founder of the Breslov branch of the Hasidic movement.
South Africa will reopen its borders to most countries on Oct. 1, President Cyril Ramaphosa said Wednesday, as the country prepares to ease other restrictions amid an improving virus situation.
A small group of wealthy countries has bought more than half of the expected supply of the most promising coronavirus vaccines, the British charity group Oxfam said Thursday. Supply deals have been announced for 5.3 billion doses of five vaccines in the last stage of clinical trials. More than 2.7 billion doses, or 51 percent, have been bought by countries including Australia, Britain, Israel, Japan, Switzerland and the United States as well as the European Union, which together represent about 13 percent of the world’s population. Even if all five vaccines are approved, their combined production capacity of six billion doses is enough for only about three billion people, since each person is likely to need two doses. That means that nearly two-thirds of the world’s population would not have a vaccine until at least 2022, Oxfam said.
U.S. ROUNDUP
More than 40 percent of U.S. school employees are at high risk for severe Covid-19 cases, an analysis finds.
A new paper published Thursday in the medical journal Health Affairs estimates that at least 42 percent of the employees who work in America’s schools are at high risk for developing severe cases of Covid-19, a significant increase over previous evaluations of the risk to school employees.
Nearly 10 million adults work in schools across the United States, including teachers, administrators and support staff members, the authors estimate. Previous research focused on teachers, concluding that roughly a quarter of them, or 1.5 million, have conditions that put them at high risk for severe complications from the coronavirus.
The new study expanded to look at all school employees, using data from a household survey that collects detailed health, socioeconomic and employment data from American families. The survey is conducted annually by the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services.
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists several factors that put people at high risk for a severe case of Covid-19, including obesity, diabetes, heart disease and being 65 or older. The study’s authors, who work for the federal research agency, estimated that at least 42 percent of school employees fall into at least one of those categories.
Obesity was the primary factor increasing school employees’ risk level, reported the authors, and support staff members were more likely to be at high risk than teachers or administrators.
The authors did not draw broad conclusions about the wisdom of reopening classrooms, describing their findings about the number of at-risk school employees as “one piece of the puzzle.” They noted that applying strategies recommended by the C.D.C., the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine can help mitigate the risks of the virus spreading in schools.
In other news from around the United States:
More than 45,000 new cases and more than 840 additional deaths were reported across the U.S. on Thursday. Montana, Utah and Wisconsin set single-day case records.
Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, citing strong progress against the virus, announced Thursday that he was easing limits on retail outlets, restaurants and other establishments throughout most of the state, but said he was continuing to hold off on reopening bars. Mr. Abbott, who imposed a series of extensive restrictions over the summer when Texas was a major U.S. hot spot, said he is moving forward with a new reopening strategy, beginning Monday in 19 of the state’s 22 hospital regions. The new guidelines expand capacity limits from 50 percent to 75 percent for retail businesses, restaurants, offices, gyms, manufacturing operations, museums and libraries.
As President Trump ramps up his promise of a safe and effective coronavirus vaccine by Election Day, the percentage of Americans willing to take a vaccine has precipitously dropped, a new poll by the Pew Research Group found. The poll, which surveyed 10,093 American adults from Sept. 8 through Sept. 13, found that 51 percent of respondents said they would get the vaccine. That’s a decline of 21 percentage points from May, when 72 percent indicated they might take it.
The House of Representatives passed a resolution on Thursday denouncing anti-Asian sentiment that has spread in the United States during the pandemic. A Senate version of the resolution was introduced in May, and its sponsors include Senator Kamala Harris of California, Joe Biden’s running mate in the presidential election. President Trump and his Republican allies have repeatedly called the coronavirus “the Chinese virus,” dismissing concerns that such language would lead to any harm.
New claims for state unemployment insurance fell last week, totaling 790,000 before adjusting for seasonal factors, the Labor Department reported Thursday. The weekly tally is roughly four times what it was before the coronavirus pandemic shut down many businesses in March.
The pastor of an evangelical church in northern Idaho has been hospitalized with Covid-19 for about two weeks after defying a county mask mandate and holding in-person worship services. Paul Van Noy, the pastor of Candlelight Christian Fellowship, a large congregation in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, a city with a population of about 52,000, was treated in the intensive care unit and has started to recover, church leaders said in a statement on Monday.
Graduate students at the University of Michigan returned to work on Thursday after an eight-day strike to demand more protection from the virus when teaching.
Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey, a Democrat, joined legislative leaders to announce a budget deal on Thursday that includes a higher tax rate for residents earning more than $1 million a year amid a pandemic-induced fiscal crisis. The agreement will raise the tax rate on earnings over $1 million to 10.75 percent, up from 8.97 percent.
No movement in stimulus talks as Pelosi defends $2.2 trillion demand that Meadows calls ‘an ultimatum.’
Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California on Thursday doubled down on demands for a stimulus bill of at least $2.2 trillion, even as White House officials signaled support for a smaller package that has drawn little enthusiasm from Democratic leaders.
“It’s hard to see how we can go any lower when you see the great needs,” Ms. Pelosi said at a news conference on Thursday arranged to call for additional relief as the country nears 200,000 pandemic-related deaths. She said Democrats had shown a willingness to compromise with the White House by lowering their overall ask by more than $1 trillion, from a $3.4-trillion relief bill the House approved in May.
At the White House, Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, dismissed Ms. Pelosi’s demand for $2.2 trillion as “not a negotiation.”
“That’s an ultimatum,” he told reporters.
Backed by top Democrats, Ms. Pelosi has continued to hold firm on the number despite growing concerns among moderate Democrats that the impasse over another relief package will last through the November election, depriving American families and businesses of critical aid. Some of them were frustrated earlier this week when Ms. Pelosi’s top lieutenants quickly panned a $1.5-trillion compromise framework presented by a bipartisan group of lawmakers in an effort to break the logjam.
President Trump, however, said he was open to the proposal, put forward by a coalition that calls itself the House Problem Solvers Caucus, a sentiment Mr. Meadows echoed.
“I’d like to see the larger number,” Mr. Trump said at a White House news conference on Wednesday. “Yeah, I would like to see it. There are some things I disagree with, but I’m sure they can be negotiated.”
But Senate Republicans, who last week presented a bare-bones stimulus measure that would provide $350 billion in new federal funding, are unlikely to support a much larger package.
Europe begins to lock down again as a W.H.O. official warns of a ‘very serious’ resurgence.
The World Health Organization on Thursday warned of a “very serious” resurgence of the coronavirus across Europe but said that transmission could be contained by local rather than national measures.
“We have a very serious situation unfolding before us,” Hans Kluge, the W.H.O.’s regional director for Europe, told reporters. “Weekly cases have now exceeded those reported when the pandemic first peaked in Europe in March.”
The number of virus cases has increased by more than 10 percent in the past two weeks in over half the countries of Europe, Dr. Kluge said. He noted that in seven countries the number of cases has doubled.
“Although these numbers reflect more comprehensive testing, they also show alarming rates of transmission,” he said. The region has recorded at least 220,000 deaths from the virus.
“In many cases, you can contain those spikes locally,” he added. “In that sense I would hope that national lockdowns can be avoided as much as possible.”
Britain’s health secretary said on Thursday that almost two million people in northeastern England would be restricted from meeting with anyone outside their households as part of the latest local lockdowns in the country.
And in France, a growing number of cities — including Lyon and Nice — are experiencing a worrying spread of the coronavirus and will have to enact new restrictions on public gatherings, the French health minister said on Thursday.
France’s rate per capita of new cases over the last seven days is currently one of the highest in Europe, with 91 cases per 100,000 residents, up from 10 at the end of July. Gatherings of family and friends have become “massive” vectors of infections, said Olivier Véran, the country’s health minister.
In the Czech Republic, roughly a quarter of the country’s 41,000 total cases were reported over the last week, as the country battles one of the fastest-growing outbreaks in Europe. In an effort to avoid a complete lockdown, the government has reintroduced targeted restrictive measures, including a ban on indoor gatherings of more than 10 people, mandatory masking indoors and reduced hours for bars and restaurants.
N.Y.C. will again delay the start of in-person classes for most students.
Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City on Thursday once again delayed the start of most in-person classes in public schools, acknowledging that the system had still not fully surmounted the many obstacles that it faced in bringing children back during the coronavirus pandemic.
The abrupt announcement was a blow to the mayor’s effort to make New York City one of the few major cities in the nation to hold in-person classes. And it threatened to deepen concerns and confusion over whether the mayor and his administration had mishandled the reopening by announcing deadlines and then pushing them back.
Instead of a triumphant return to schools for all students who wanted in-person learning beginning on Monday, the city will phase students back into classrooms on a rolling basis, starting with the youngest children, who will report to schools next week. Students in pre-K classes and students with advanced special needs will return on Monday.
On Sept. 29, elementary schools will open, and middle and high schools will open on Oct. 1.
All other students will begin the school year remotely on Monday.
The mayor said at a news conference on Thursday morning that he decided to opt for a phased-in reopening after having an hourslong conversation on Wednesday with the leaders of the unions representing the city’s principals and teachers.
Those union leaders have been explicitly warning for weeks that schools were not ready to reopen for myriad reasons, from poor ventilation in some aging buildings to a severe staffing crunch that the principals’ union estimated could leave the city needing as many as 10,000 educators.
Mr. de Blasio said that the teacher shortage was his main reason for again delaying in-person classes.
“We are doing this to make sure that all the standards we’ve set can be achieved,” Mr. de Blasio said on Thursday morning, adding that the reopening plan was derived by studying “the best practices from around the world.”
Over 40 percent of parents have already opted out of in-person classes, and that number is likely to grow, reflecting families’ deep frustration about the city’s reopening effort and skepticism about schools’ readiness.
Moderna and Pfizer, two drugmakers leading the vaccine race, spell out how they are conducting late-stage trials.
Moderna and Pfizer, two drug companies that are leading the race to develop coronavirus vaccines, on Thursday released comprehensive road maps of their clinical trials.
Companies typically wait to share these plans, or protocols, until after studies are complete. The disclosures during the trials, a rare move, were aimed at addressing growing suspicion among Americans that President Trump’s drive to produce a vaccine before the election on Nov. 3 could result in a product that is unsafe.
The plans include information about how participants are being selected and monitored, the conditions under which the trials could be stopped early if there were problems, and the evidence researchers will use to determine whether people who got the vaccines were protected from Covid-19. Moderna’s study will involve 30,000 participants, and Pfizer’s 44,000.
The plan released by Moderna on Thursday morning included a likely timetable for determining whether its vaccine works that could reach into next year. That did not jibe with the president’s optimistic predictions of a vaccine widely available to the public in October. Rather, it indicated that the company’s first analysis of early trial data might not be conducted until late December, though company officials now say they expect the initial analysis in November. The final analysis might not take place until months later, heading into the spring of next year.
Pfizer’s plan does not appear to estimate when its results could be available. Its chief executive has said repeatedly that the company hopes to have an answer as early as October. Moderna has said only that it might have a result before the end of the year.
Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told senators on Wednesday that a vaccine would not be widely available until the middle of next year. Hours later, Mr. Trump sharply contradicted him, making unsubstantiated projections that a vaccine could become widely available weeks from now.
Pregnant women who are hospitalized for Covid-19 may have a greater risk of premature birth, studies say.
Pregnant women who are infected with the coronavirus and hospitalized are at risk for developing serious complications, and may face an elevated risk for delivering their babies prematurely, according to new studies from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They may also be at greater risk of losing the pregnancy or having a stillbirth.
The troubling findings are consistent with some earlier reports that pregnant women may be at increased risk for severe illness when they become infected with the new coronavirus. But some experts warned that the findings, drawn from relatively small numbers of patients, including many hospitalized because of Covid-19, may not be representative of all pregnant women who are infected.
The studies found that many hospitalized pregnant women who were infected with the virus did not have any symptoms. Among those who did have symptoms, however, between 16 percent and 30 percent required intensive care, and 6 percent to 8.5 percent required ventilators to help with breathing. Among the 703 cases described in the two reports, three women died.
Both studies found that pregnant women infected with the coronavirus experienced a higher rate of preterm deliveries than expected, and some had stillbirths. Earlier studies have also suggested a higher risk for preterm births, and a British study noted a population-wide uptick in stillbirths during the pandemic.
A county in Florida made great strides controlling the coronavirus. Then it was battered by Hurricane Sally.
Escambia County, which includes Pensacola, saw tremendous progress on the pandemic front since earlier this summer. The county now averages about 50 new cases per day, down from around 270 in mid-July.
There is now some concern that evacuations because of the huge floods from Hurricane Sally, which slammed into the Gulf Coast as a strong Category 2 storm on Wednesday, could result in renewed spread. So public officials in Escambia have urged people who cannot be in their homes to seek places to stay with family and friends and resort to public shelters only as a very last resort.
“We’ve had challenges from hurricanes many times, but never during a pandemic,” Commissioner Lumon May said in a briefing on Thursday.
Escambia got a handle on its infections in part thanks to an extensive public health campaign on television, radio, social media and billboards urging people to wear masks, said Laura Coale, the county’s communications director. The county also helped distribute masks and hand sanitizer. Facial coverings are required in Pensacola and strongly recommended in the rest of the county. Public officials have been wearing them in news briefings except for when they are behind the microphone.
“We have miles and miles of beach that are spread out, so you have a great opportunity to be able to socially distance,” Ms. Coale said, before catching herself to note how the storm had flooded the coastline. “Well — it’s different now,” she said.
France to enact new restrictions in some cities amid spike in cases, the health minister says.
A growing number of cities in France are experiencing a worrying spread of the coronavirus and will have to enact new restrictions on public gatherings, the French health minister said on Thursday as he urged people to reduce their social contacts.
Olivier Véran, the minister, said at a news conference that local authorities in the cities of Lyon and Nice plan to tighten restrictions in the coming days, and he warned that other cities like Paris, Dijon or Toulouse might have to do the same soon.
“The epidemic is once again very active in our country,” Mr. Véran said.
France’s rate per capita of new cases over the last seven days is currently one of the highest in Europe, with 91 cases per 100,000 residents, up from 10 at the end of July. Gatherings of family and friends had become “massive” vectors of infections, Mr. Véran said.
In cities like Marseille and Bordeaux — where the number of cases has surged the most, and where authorities had limited public gatherings to 10 people last week — Mr. Véran said authorities might have to close bars and restaurants or ban gatherings completely.
Mr. Véran said that France had carried out over 1.2 million tests over the past week, but he acknowledged that massive demand had led to long lines and growing waiting times. Hundreds of medical lab workers even went on strike on Thursday over strained working conditions because of the overwhelming demand. Mr. Véran said the authorities were improving the process, while working on rolling out faster antibody tests and greenlighting saliva tests.
Mr. Véran also said that the authorities were able to monitor the pandemic much more closely than they could in the spring and that doctors have improved at treating severe cases of the virus.
“We are not fighting with the same weapons and we know our opponent better,” Mr. Véran said.

Restaurants have increased their capacity with additional outdoor seating, small groups have moved their meetings to outside spaces where social distancing can be maintained, some churches are holding outdoor worship services, fitness classes have been moved to parks, and moviegoers are flocking to drive-in theaters.
For many Coloradans, the outdoors has provided a welcome respite over the past six months from restrictions designed to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, that causes COVID-19.
As the weather cools, though, and we’re forced to spend more time indoors, what will we do?
Several scientific studies on how the COVID-19 virus is spread have determined that the risk of transmission indoors is significantly higher than it is outdoors. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said the risk indoors is 20 times higher than it is outdoors during a recent news conference, and an aggregate of studies worldwide basically confirms that, with an average risk factor that is 18.6 times higher indoors than out, said John Volckens, director of Colorado State University’s Center for Energy Development and Health.
Volckens, fellow CSU mechanical and environmental engineering professor Tami Bond, and University of Colorado chemistry and biochemistry professor Jose Jimenez have been heavily involved in research on the airborne transmission of COVID-19. Volckens, in fact, hosted a webinar on the topic late last month for the National Academy of Sciences that brought researchers throughout the world — including Bond and Jimenez — together to share their findings.
The virus, they said, spreads through the air in tiny particles 500 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair that can remain suspended for several hours. Outdoors, those particles dissipate quickly, like smoke from a cigarette. Indoors, just like that cigarette smoke, they accumulate over time and linger.
“If you want to be safe, do things outdoors,” Jimenez said Tuesday during in a webinar with alumni.
The more time you spend indoors, breathing air that others are exhaling, the more likely you are to breathe in enough particles containing the COVID-19 virus to become infected, they said. Masks and other face coverings reduce that risk but don’t eliminate it. Same with social-distancing, they said.
“We have some real challenges ahead of us, especially with wintertime coming up,” Volckens said.
Every documented “super-spreader” event that the three researchers were familiar with — where large numbers of people were infected at the same time in the same location — has occurred indoors, they said.
None of the three — Volckens, Bond or Jimenez — are comfortable sitting down and eating indoors at a restaurant right now, they said. Volckens wears his mask everywhere other than inside his home around his own family, and Jimenez said he won’t travel on an airplane again until there is an effective and widely distributed vaccine for COVID-19.
“I try to do as little as possible right now indoors with strangers,” Volckens said.
Bond says she still walks into a coffee shop most mornings to order a cup to go and often eats in outdoor dining areas at restaurants and bars in and around Fort Collins.
“My personal level of concern is really focused on avoiding crowding,” she said, “so I think that there is potential that we can create safe indoor spaces. But we can’t ever have the density that we’re used to.”
Indoor concerts or sporting events that draw large crowds are simply too dangerous to even consider right now, she said. She still cuts her own hair, too, to avoid close contact for a prolonged period of time with a hair stylist who is cutting the hair of dozens of other clients each week. And, she admits, she hasn’t seen a dentist since the pandemic was first identified in the United States in early March.
How to gauge risk of getting COVID-19
In general, the three researchers said, the risk of contracting COVID-19 indoors is a bit of a common-sense calculation: How many people will you come in contact with? How close will that contact be and for how long? Are you and others wearing masks or other face coverings?
Other factors come into play, too, though.
Jimenez said it’s important to know the rate of infection in a specific area while weighing the risks of various indoor settings. If you’re going to be inside with 10 others in an area where the rate of infection is 1 per 1,000, there’s only a 1% chance one of the people around you in that setting will be infected. If you go to a gathering in the same area with 1,000 people, “you are approaching a 100% chance that someone is infected right there,” he said.
Ventilation systems are also important. The rate in which indoor air is filtered and or replaced by outside air also plays a significant role. Assuming the same safety protocols are in place, including the wearing of masks and social distancing, students and teachers are going to be a lot safer in a modern school building with extensive air-exchange systems built in to its heating and cooling systems than in a 100-year-old classroom where the only ventilation options are opening windows and doors, Volckens said.
“That’s why there’s no tried and true formula for indoors, because every indoor environment is different,” Volckens said.
Maybe most important of all is the behavior of others in that environment, they said. Are they all wearing masks? Do those masks fit properly, tightly covering the nose and mouth, and actually provide a filter to the air they’re exhaling? Masks that fog up glasses or cause you to blink when you exhale in front of a mirror do not fit properly and won’t provide the same protection to your or others that a proper fitting mask or face covering will, he said.
Are the people you’ll come in contact with practicing social distancing, doing what they can to remain 6 feet or more from one another? Although airborne particles containing the SARS-CoV-2 virus can travel much farther than 6 or even 12 feet, the researchers said, those particles will dissipate over distance, decreasing the chances of delivering a large enough viral load to infect someone else in the room.
And what are you and the people around you doing? More particles of the virus are emitted when an infected person is speaking loudly or singing than when that person is speaking softly or simply in the room breathing, Volckens said, because of the proximity of the vocal chords to the lungs, where the COVID-19 disease most often develops.
Information published and distributed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization suggests the virus can be transmitted only through large particles emitted through coughing, sneezing, singing or talking. Research by Volckens, Bond, Jimenez and as many as 200 others have shown airborne transmission is possible indoors from tiny particles through the simple act of breathing.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, acknowledged that finding last week during a webinar with researchers, Jimenez said.
Bond’s current research is focused on determining models for safe levels of indoor interaction based on the amount of breath people are exchanging. People can’t stay home in isolation forever, she said.
“There are levels at which we don’t see transmission (of COVID-19), and if you knew that and could limit your interactions below those levels, then one could consider them mostly safe,” she said. “There’s nothing that’s 100% safe.
“I think one of the really burdensome things for every member of the public has been having to worry about absolutely everything, and people can’t live like that. What I’m hoping is through this challenging time we can figure out ways to determine quickly what is safe and to communicate that to people quickly, so they know what to avoid.
“Our situation right now is 'pretty much everything can kill you except for staying at home.' ”
Still, Volckens said, we all have the ability to mitigate our risk of contracting COVID-19, regardless of the environment. It’s a bit like defensive driving, he said, weighing the risk factors of your actions, knowing you can’t control the actions of others who might positively or negatively alter that risk factor.
You can wash your hands with soap and water or hand sanitizer after touching a frequently used gas pump or door handle. You can wear a mask when you go indoors to a space where others have been talking or breathing. You can altogether avoid places you believe present the highest risk of transmission, whether it be a crowded nightclub or a certain grocery or department store at its busiest time.
“You’ll never get 100% of the people to wear a mask 100% of the time, but you have it within your power to protect yourself in three ways — with your hygiene, masking and decision-making.”

The recommendation Friday reverses controversial guidance the agency issued at the end of August, which said that someone who was in close contact (within 6 feet) of an infected person for at least 15 minutes but doesn’t have symptoms does not ""necessarily need a test.""
Asked about the timeline for a coronavirus vaccine, President Donald Trump on Friday said the U.S. will have manufactured more than 100,000,000 doses of vaccine before the end of the year, with ""enough vaccines for every American by April."" But CDC Director Robert Redfield told a Senate panel this week that a vaccine may not be available to the American public until summer or fall 2021.
Meanwhile, Texas and Nevada are set to ease restrictions for some businesses beginning this weekend, and four more states began-in person voting Friday.
Some significant developments:
As in-person voting began in Virginia on Friday, lines at voting locations in Fairfax County were already out the door. A photo shared by the county on Twitter showed a long line of people wearing masks, standing 6 feet apart on sidewalks or camped out on benches and curbs.
The U.S. public is still divided over whether to get COVID-19 vaccine one it becomes available, with nearly half saying they wouldn't get vaccinated in a Pew Research Center survey.
A drafted announcement that was never sent illustrates how the United States Postal Service had planned to send 650 million masks to Americans during the early parts of the pandemic, according to a document obtained by the watchdog group American Oversight through the Freedom of Information Act.
Moderna, one of the companies leading the effort to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, announced it could have enough clinical trial results as soon as November to confirm the effectiveness of its candidate vaccine.
📈 Today's numbers: The U.S. has reported more than 6.6 million cases and 198,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Globally, there have been more than 30 million cases and 947,000 fatalities. New case records were set in six states: Arkansas, Montana, North Dakota, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming, according to a USA TODAY analysis of Johns Hopkins data. Record numbers of deaths were reported in Kansas, North Dakota and Puerto Rico.

Parents knowingly sent child to school with COVID-19
Twenty-nine high school students in Massachusetts were told to quarantine after parents sent their child to in-person class despite having tested positive for the coronavirus days earlier, reports say.
According to NBC News, the student tested Sept. 9 and got positive results back on Sept. 11. They went for their first day of class at Attleboro High School, located about 39 miles southwest of Boston, on Sept. 14.
Parents learned the next day that a student who attended the public school had tested positive for COVID-19, according to a letter sent to parents obtained by USA TODAY.
CDC reverses controversial guidance on COVID-19 testing
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reversed controversial guidance on coronavirus testing Friday, now recommending that people who have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 should get tested, even if they're not symptomatic.
The recommendation departs from guidance the agency issued at the end of August, which said that someone who was in close contact (within 6 feet) of an infected person for at least 15 minutes but doesn’t have symptoms does not ""necessarily need a test.""
Infectious disease experts were confused and troubled by the change, as people who are not showing symptoms can still have and spread COVID-19.
The CDC estimates that 40% of infections are asymptomatic and 50% of transmissions occur before symptoms appear. Experts worry that failing to test asymptomatic carriers could not only result in more infections but also hinder contact tracing efforts.
CDC director called in favor to help Nevada GOP leader get COVID-19 test
A USA TODAY investigation found that Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the CDC, called Nevada’s chief medical officer in early March to request a COVID-19 test for a Nevada GOP leader who could not get one.
Adam Laxalt, the former attorney general of Nevada until 2019 and booster for President Donald Trump, believed he was exposed to the coronavirus while attending the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland. But Laxalt was not showing symptoms and could not get approved for a test through a local hospital back home.
On the phone call, Redfield asked the medical officer, Dr. Ihsan Azzam, to get it done, according to interviews and internal communications USA TODAY received through records requests.
The special treatment is a stark example of how political influence has penetrated the CDC during the COVID-19 pandemic, creating challenges for local health authorities. It came at a time when his agency knew thousands of Americans needed testing but could not get it due to supply shortages.

Europe battles COVID-19 resurgence
Amid a rising number of COVID-19 cases in Europe, several nations are implementing new restrictions.
England: A ban on social gatherings of more than six people, including children, went into effect this week, and fresh nationwide lockdown restrictions appear to be in the cards soon.
Denmark: Officials announced a nationwide order lowering the size of approved gatherings from 100 to 50 and telling cafes, bars and restaurants to close at 10 p.m. instead of midnight.
Spain: A line of tents has been installed at the gates of a Madrid military hospital four months after similar structures for triaging patients were taken down. Spain’s Defense Ministry said the tents are empty, installed protectively ahead of the second wave taking hold on the Spanish capital.
Italy: The Sicilian town of Corleone, made famous by the fictional Mafia clan in ""The Godfather,"" has ordered schools closed and a limited lockdown because of a coronavirus spike.
Meanwhile, Israel has returned to a full lockdown to contain a worsening coronavirus outbreak.

270 million are 'marching toward the brink of starvation' amid pandemic
U.N. World Food Program chief David Beasley is warning that 270 million people are ""marching toward the brink of starvation"" because of the toxic combination of conflict, climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic.
Beasley on Thursday urged donor nations and billionaires to contribute $4.9 billion to feed the 30 million he said will die without U.N. assistance. He reminded the U.N. Security Council of his warning five months ago that ""the world stood on the brink of a hunger pandemic,"" and welcomed the response then, which averted famine and led countries to fight back against the coronavirus.

13% of world's population have purchased majority of promised vaccines
Wealthy nations representing 13% of the world’s population have already purchased approximately 51% of the promised doses of leading COVID-19 vaccine candidates, nonprofit group Oxfam warned Thursday.
Oxfam analyzed the deals that pharmaceutical corporations and vaccine producers made with nations around the world for the five leading vaccine candidates in phase 3 clinical trials. Even in the event that all five vaccines succeed, nearly two-thirds of the world’s population will not have a vaccine until at least 2022, Oxfam estimates.
Earlier this week, researchers at Northeastern University warned that more people will die if wealthy nations hoard vaccines. The models found 61% of deaths could be averted if the vaccine was distributed to all countries proportional to population, while only 33% of deaths would be averted if high-income countries got the vaccines first.
Nearly half of school employees in high risk group for COVID-19, study says
While students may be in the group that poses the least risk for COVID-19 infection, a study says nearly half of school employees potentially have the highest risk.
According to a pre-print study to be published in Health Affairs, between 42% to about 51% of all school employees meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s definition for being at increased risk for COVID-19.
The CDC says that underlying health conditions, such as obesity, diabetes and heart disease, and older age put people into the highest risk groups.
The results align closely with a recent survey by the Education Week Research Center that said 43% of teachers have reported having a physical condition that makes them vulnerable to COVID-19.
USPS scrapped plan to send 650M masks to Americans, document reveals
A plan by the United States Postal Service to send 650 million masks to Americans at the start of the pandemic was scrapped, according to a document obtained by the watchdog group American Oversight through the Freedom of Information Act.
The announcement, which was first reported by the Washington Post on Friday, was drafted but never sent. USPS said in the plan that first shipments of masks were expected to reach U.S. households at an unspecified date in April.
The document demonstrates how the Postal Service’s role in the pandemic response may have been more involved than initially reported this spring.
Nearly half of US public say they wouldn’t get a COVID-19 vaccine: Pew study
Even after government agencies and pharmaceutical companies pledged their independence in the race to find a vaccine for the coronavirus, Americans are still divided over whether they would get vaccinated.
According to a Pew Research Center survey, nearly half of U.S. adults (49%) say they definitely or probably would not get vaccinated at this time. Intent to get a COVID-19 vaccine has fallen by 21% since May.
While intent to get a vaccinated has declined across all major political and demographic groups, some differences remain. Just 32% of Black adults say they would definitely get a vaccine compared with 52% of white adults, 56% of Hispanics and 72% of Asian Americans.
The national survey was conducted Sept. 8-13 among more than 10,000 U.S. adults.
Las Vegas bars, taprooms, breweries will be allowed to reopen on Sunday
After a six-month shutdown due to COVID-19, Nevada officials announced bars, taprooms and breweries can reopen Sunday night in Clark County, where Las Vegas is located. Nevada's COVID-19 Mitigation and Management Task Force on Thursday unanimously approved the county's plan to reopen drinking businesses throughout the Las Vegas Valley.
Clark County Commission Chairwoman Marilyn Kirkpatrick told the task force that bar owners are committed to following health and safety protocols. State biostatistician Kyra Morgan revealed the COVID-19 positivity rate dropped from 8.6% to 7.8% between Monday and Thursday. The World Health Organization's recommends that rate should be no higher than 5%.
Meanwhile, one resort, Wynn Las Vegas has logged almost 500 positive COVID-19 cases among employees since it reopened in June.

Utah governor considers statewide mask mandate amid COVID-19 surge
Utah Gov. Gary Herbert said Thursday he is considering a statewide mask mandate and planning expanded coronavirus testing in response to what he called an alarming spike of infections in the state.
The state counted 911 new confirmed cases on Thursday, a new record for any single day. The rolling average of daily new cases has increased by about 54% over the past two weeks, according to state data, and has jumped to 661 per day this week compared to 381 per day last week.
""We are taking this spike and the magnitude of it very seriously,"" Herbert told reporters.
Herbert, a Republican, has urged residents to wear masks for months but has stopped short of implementing a statewide mandate. He has instead allowed counties to decide if they needed bans.

India's coronavirus case count increases by 96K over 24 hours
India's coronavirus cases jumped by another 96,424 infections in the past 24 hours, showing little sign of leveling.
The Health Ministry on Friday raised the nation’s total past 5.21 million, or about 0.37% of its nearly 1.4 billion people. It said 1,174 more people died in the past 24 hours, for a total of 84,372 fatalities, but experts say India's death toll may be a significant undercount.
India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his birthday on Thursday made a fresh appeal to people to wear masks and maintain social distance as his government chalked out plans to handle big congregations expected during a major Hindu festival season beginning next month.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott relaxes limit restrictions on businesses; bars must stay closed
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Thursday that he would allow businesses to expand pandemic limits on capacity in most of the state, citing a decline in coronavirus hospitalizations.
The order allows businesses operating at 50% capacity to move to 75% starting Monday. That includes restaurants, retail, office buildings, manufacturing, gyms, libraries and museums. Bars remain closed under the order, although some have been able to reopen by selling more food than alcohol.
""Without vaccines available, containing COVID is a challenge, but Texans have already shown that they are up to that challenge,"" Abbott said at a Capitol news conference. ""As we go about the process to continue to contain COVID, we will also continue to work to open up Texas.""
And Abbott is allowing hospitals in much of the state to resume elective surgeries, effective immediately. Nursing homes and other long-term care facilities may resume visitations next Thursday, as long as there are no outbreaks at those facilities.

Survey: 751 Arizona teachers have resigned or retired since school began
There are fewer teachers than ever in Arizona classrooms, according to a new survey from the Arizona School Personnel Administrators Association.
Just a few weeks into the school year, about 28% of teacher positions in the state remained vacant compared with 21% vacant last year, the data shows, which means about 3 in 10 classrooms are not led by a qualified teacher. Schools have had to fill those open positions with long-term substitute teachers or others without teaching qualifications.
Teachers across the state have said COVID-19 adds to the pressure to quit, especially when faced with the threat of returning to the classroom amid the pandemic. Some medically vulnerable teachers are particularly worried about contracting the virus while around students. Arizona school districts had about 6,145 open positions this year — 1,728 remain vacant, compared with 1,443 in 2019.

Moderna says vaccine trial results could come in November
Moderna, one of the companies leading the effort to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, announced Thursday it could have enough clinical trial results as soon as November to confirm the effectiveness of its candidate vaccine.
Results of the vaccine’s effectiveness will be presented to an independent review committee after 53 people in the trial contract COVID-19, and again after 106 and 151 infections. Half the participants are getting a placebo and half the active vaccine, called mRNA-1273.
Statistically, if the vaccine is effective 75% of the time, it should take only 106 infections in both groups to prove its effectiveness, Dr. Jacqueline Miller, Moderna’s senior vice president of infectious disease development, told company investors on Thursday. At that point, which will likely come in November, Moderna could apply for an emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to begin distributing the vaccine.
The FDA has said a vaccine must be at least 50% effective to win federal approval, but the companies developing vaccines have said they are aiming for at least 60% and hopefully even higher effectiveness. Moderna had originally predicted that it might take until May 2021 to prove its vaccine’s effectiveness, but pushed up that timeline because participants joined quickly, the COVID-19 infection rate remained high around trial sites and the company was able to start the trial earlier than originally expected.

What provoked your research into COVID-19 infections?
Upon the emergence of the virus in China in December 2019, the University of Washington Virology Laboratory began preparing to perform both clinical testing of patient samples as well as sequencing of the virus itself to evaluate the way it spreads in the population and mutates over time.
When the outbreak in Washington state was first discovered in late February, the entire Division of Virology, including my lab, immediately mobilized to direct efforts to studying SARS-CoV-2.
I had previously studied the immune system, so right away I started looking at how COVID-19 affects the host immune response.

Up until now, it was unknown why COVID-19 infections tend to be more severe in older adults and males. Why is this?
Much of our understanding of how viruses affect different populations comes from controlled experiments on isolated cells or animals – it is really difficult to make causal conclusions from the observations of the virus “in the wild”.
I think that our data showing that there are differences in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in older adults and males is compelling, but the direct causal relationship between immune system differences and poorer outcomes in these groups will need to be confirmed in controlled laboratory experiments. These experiments just take some time.
In your research, you investigated the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. Can you describe how you carried out this research?
We used a technique called “RNA sequencing”, or RNAseq. When a diagnostic nasopharyngeal (NP) swab is taken, it collects both viral RNA and human RNA. In humans, RNA is transcribed from DNA genes and provides the instructions to a cell to make proteins, including the proteins used by the immune system to respond to and alert neighboring cells to a viral infection.
We isolated RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs and compared the relative levels of each RNA between SARS-CoV-2 infected and uninfected individuals. We found RNAs encoding many genes to be increased or decreased in virus-infected individuals relative to controls. In this way, we were able to get a global picture of how the immune system responds to the virus.
What did you discover?
We found that classical antiviral pathways were activated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, in people aged 60 and over, the genes that help to recruit immune effector cells – the immune cells that can actually eliminate infected cells – were much less activated than in their younger counterparts. This suggests that older individuals may not be as able to clear the viral infection.
Additionally, males had increased levels of genes that tell the immune system to dial back the antiviral response. We cannot say with certainty that these observations are responsible for the increased morbidity and mortality in elderly and male SARS-CoV-2 patients, but they could certainly be important contributing factors.

How does viral load affect the severity of the SARS-CoV-2 infection?
We found that viral load was correlated with the degree to which the antiviral response was turned on – patients with a larger amount of virus also had a larger amount of antiviral immune response genes.
We did not have access to the data on the clinical outcomes of the patients included in our study, but other investigators have demonstrated that larger amounts of the virus are correlated with more severe infection.
How does your research help guide potential treatments for the SARS-CoV-2 infection?
I think our study shows that some of the clinical trials of different types of interferons – the body’s most potent antiviral mediators – might be on the right track. I am looking forward to seeing those results.
Do you believe that with your research, we can further help to understand COVID-19 and potentially save lives?
I think at this stage of the pandemic, any carefully conducted, peer-reviewed research is helpful – there is still so much to understand about this virus and how it affects its human hosts.
I am very hopeful that our study provides important information to other scientists and clinicians working more directly on treatments.
What can older adults and males do to help protect themselves from COVID-19?
The same things the rest of us can – wear a mask, keep plenty of distance during social interactions, and regular handwashing. And although that is difficult, I hope they can take heart in the fact that there is a massive collaborative effort by tens of thousands of scientists across the world to understand this virus and develop treatments.

What further research needs to be carried out before we can conclusively state that age and gender have an impact on COVID-19 severity?
I think that at this point, the data from clinical studies of patient outcomes is extremely clear that older age and male sex are important risk factors for more severe COVID-19. Understanding the mechanisms behind these differences in outcomes will require studies in a wide array of animal models, efforts that are already underway.
Additionally, more studies the patient immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection combined with detailed demographic and clinical outcome data will likely also be an important piece of the puzzle.
Why are swabs from the nasopharynx not as reliable as other anatomic locations?
Swabs from the nasopharynx are fantastic. In many ways, they are still the gold standard for sampling. SARS-CoV-2 can infect the lungs and it is hard to get samples from the lower respiratory tract, so nasopharyngeal swabs may not capture those cases, but there is not necessarily a better alternative.
Saliva has shown some promise though sample-to-sample variability can be quite high. And then nasal swabs generally work well as well.

What are the next steps in your research into COVID-19 immune responses?
I am looking forward to studying the interplay between SARS-CoV-2 infection, the immune response, and how those factors may influence the development of secondary bacterial infections such as pneumonia, complications that are responsible for a large percentage of SARS-CoV-2-related deaths.

“We are doing this to make sure that all the standards we’ve set can be achieved,” de Blasio said.
The mayor said the city intends to add 4,500 educators to beef up a staff depleted by the pandemic by drawing on graduate and adjunct professors at the City University of New York, substitute teachers and “several thousand” people who already work for the Department of Education in other capacities.
“This is a huge undertaking,"" de Blasio said of a school system with 1.1 million students. ""It is difficult. It’s challenging. It’s not the easy way. It is in fact the hard way, but it’s the right way.""
NYC mayor announces most classroom reopening postponed until October
Sept. 17, 202002:13
On top of that, the city will address some of the nagging infrastructure problems like poor ventilation in aging school buildings, the mayor and union officials said.
“There are some blanks that we need to fill in,"" teachers union leader Michael Mulgrew said at a news conference with de Blasio. “We must make sure we get this right.""
Only pre-schoolers will be returning to classrooms on Monday, said Mulgrew, whose union represents 133,000 teachers and other education workers.
Kids from kindergarten through eighth grade will return on Sept. 29, while the middle schools and high schools will re-open for in-person learning on Oct. 1.
Some two weeks ago, de Blasio announced that schools would not reopen on Sept. 10, as the city had planned, after teachers said that there were not enough Covid-19 safeguards in place and threatened to strike.
De Blasio’s announcement came as the battle over how best to reopen schools during a pandemic continued to be fought in districts across the country, often pitting teachers against President Donald Trump's administration, which has been pushing hard to get pupils back into classrooms even in states that are still reporting large numbers of new Covid-19 cases.
In South Dakota, where 667 infections have been reported among students and staffers since school started, teachers and others told lawmakers Wednesday that containing the coronavirus has been a “nightmare” so far.
While the total number of new cases in South Dakota are down 4.34 percent over the past two weeks, the number of new deaths are up by 64 percent, the latest NBC News figures show. So far, the sparsely populated state has recorded a total of 192 deaths and 17,291 confirmed cases.
In Massachusetts, 30 students who attend Attleboro High School were placed in quarantine for two weeks after they came into contact with a classmate who has Covid-19 -- and who was sent to school by parents who knew their son was infected, officials said.
Attleboro Mayor Paul Heroux said this was ""an egregious violation of the rules.""
""The kid got tested Wednesday, learned he was positive on Friday, and was sent back to school by his parents on Monday,"" Heroux told NBC News. ""The mother claims their doctor told them it was okay for him to go back to school. We're not buying that. The whole world has been dealing with this months and everybody knows you need to quarantine for 14 days.""
Heroux said the parents could face civil action from their son's classmates' families.
Massachusetts, which was a hot spot in the early days of the pandemic, had reported as of Thursday 9,254 deaths and 125,699 confirmed coronavirus cases, according to NBC News numbers.
Meanwhile, Attorney General William Barr was being lambasted for saying that lockdowns that were put in place to stop the spread of the coronavirus were surpassed only by slavery as the “greatest intrusion on civil liberties” in the nation’s history.
Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., a former civil right activist, called Barr’s remark one of the “most ridiculous, tone-deaf, God-awful things I have ever heard.”
“It is incredible the chief law enforcement officer in this country (would) equate human bondage to expert advice to save lives,” Clyburn, the House majority whip, said on CNN. “Slavery was not about saving lives, it was about devaluing lives. The pandemic is a threat to human life.”
Barr has been one of the most stalwart defenders of Trump, who has been accused of lying to the American public about the dangers of the pandemic after he was caught on tape in February privately telling journalist Bob Woodward that Covid-19 was “deadly stuff.”
Trump has denied lying to the country. But he opposed the lockdowns, was resistant to donning a face mask, and pressured Republican governors to reopen their states just as the crisis was getting worse, sparking a surge in new cases and deaths across the Sun Belt and South that is only now starting to abate.
The U.S. is closing in on 200,000 Covid-19 deaths and leads the world with 6.7 million confirmed cases, the NBC News figures show.
The U.S. accounts for over a fifth of the world’s 942,076 fatalities and a fifth of the nearly 30 million cases, according to the Johns Hopkins University Covid-19 dashboard.
In other coronavirus news:
The number of people filing for first-time unemployment benefits ticked down slightly Thursday to around 860,000, according to new data from the federal Department of Labor. Also, the number of continuing claims, which represents people filing for ongoing benefits, fell by almost 1 million, to 12.6 million. But economists found little to cheer about in the new figures. ""Economic hardship continues to occur on a massive scale because coronavirus remains uncurbed,"" said AnnElizabeth Konkel, an economist at Indeed Hiring Lab. ""Overall, a fuller labor market recovery appears to have stalled out. Covid case clusters continue to pop up, and businesses continue to close doors, affecting the livelihood of millions. Until this cycle is broken, a complete economic recovery remains out of reach."" Trump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, insisted that the economy was recovering faster than anybody expected and to suggest otherwise was “silly.”
Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said there’s no upside to trying to enforce her state’s mask mandate or social distancing requirements at Trump’s campaign rallies. “The federal guidelines will tell you it’s unsafe to pack people into a venue, without masks where people are projecting their voices,” Whitmer, a Democrat, said. “That being said, we know that there are First Amendment rights here that are at issue. We also know that the practicalities of going in and enforcing this on candidates probably doesn’t make a lot of sense.” Nevertheless, Whitmer urged the Trump campaign to follow the state rules to keep participants safe. The governor’s remarks came after several thousand Trump supporters flouted safety rules by crowding mask-less into a rally last week in Saginaw, Michigan. Public health officials fear this may have been a “superspreader” event.
Thirteen U.S. allies think China has done a better job of dealing with the coronavirus than Trump has, a new Pew Research Center survey found. China is where the pandemic is believed to have started. But while Trump continues to refer to Covid-19 as the “China Virus,” it’s the U.S. that has lost the most prestige on the world stage because of his administration’s botched response to the crisis. “Across the 13 nations surveyed, a median of just 15% say the U.S. has done a good job of dealing with the outbreak,” the survey found. By contrast, 37 percent said China has done a “good job” dealing with the crisis.
Back in April when the pandemic was spreading fast across the Northeast, the U.S. Postal Service ""drafted a news release announcing plans to distribute 650 million masks nationwide, enough to offer five face coverings to every American household,"" The Washington Post reported. The White House ""nixed the plan."" ""There was concern from some in the White House Domestic Policy Council and the office of the vice president that households receiving masks might create concern or panic,” one administration official told the paper. Instead,the government created Project America Strong which has distributed some 600 million masks to schools, faith-based and other organizations. Dr. Monica Gandhi from the University of California San Francisco told NBC News mailing masks directly to everyone's home would have have driven home the message ""this is so important that we are going to put them in the mail and get them to you."" Trump and his postmaster Louis DeJoy have been accused of politicizing the USPS and hamstringing its operations to sabotage mail-in balloting. “How many times has he come out and blatantly said, ‘Don’t bail out the post office because we don't want them to do mail-in ballots,’” Paul McKenna, president of the Milwaukee area American Postal Workers Union, said last month of Trump. “So what other conclusion can you have?”"

Tuscaloosa: Local coronavirus cases have not increased dramatically from an expected Labor Day spike, but Mayor Walt Maddox said he foresees no early removal of an executive order limiting bar occupancy and restaurant operations. University of Alabama police have been actively policing students, issuing a total of 203 student non-academic misconduct citations for mask or face covering violations since mid-August. And while a total of 63 face covering citations and 29 occupation violations have been issued by Tuscaloosa police during that same period, the mayor said that doesn’t reflect the actions of most Tuscaloosa residents, business owners and students. “What gets lost is the vast majority of citizens, students (and) business owners are all doing the right things to get us out of this sooner,” Maddox said. “It should make all of us proud that we continue to be a model across the nation.”
Alaska
Kasigluk: The only store in the village was lost to a fire fought by residents who could not get help from neighboring communities because of a coronavirus lockdown. The store in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta village of Kasigluk burned Sept. 10, leaving residents without a place in town to buy groceries, clothes or other supplies, KYUK-AM reports. The store’s owners are investigating the cause of the fire, Kasigluk Police Chief Brian Noratak said. He said he would normally have called the nearby villages of Nunapitchuk and Atmautluak, but after closing to nonresidents to stem the spread of the coronavirus, he was forced to seek assistance over the radio from the people living in Kasigluk. Noratak asked Atmautluak for extra water hoses, which were delivered by boat, but Kasigluk residents fought the flames, including people who left quarantine to assist. Everything in the store burned, including groceries, electronics and clothes.
Arizona
Phoenix: At least 11 people infected with COVID-19 traveled to the state and passed the disease to others, starting local transmission chains that seeded Arizona’s earliest coronavirus outbreaks starting in mid-February, according to a newly published paper. Looking at genomes sequenced from virus samples collected in March and early April, researchers found that 80% of the studied genomes stemmed from those 11 people. They likely arrived through domestic travel, but the genomes can ultimately be traced back to virus lineages that circulated heavily in Europe before they came to the United States, the researchers found. Those are among the findings from the first paper published by the Arizona COVID-19 Genomics Union. The researchers found that a person who was isolated in January with COVID-19 after traveling to the epicenter of the outbreak, in China’s Hubei province, did not infect anybody else. “We were able to determine that public health interventions do work,” said Brendan Larson, a Ph.D. student at University of Arizona who is working on the project.
Arkansas
Little Rock: The state on Tuesday surpassed 1,000 total deaths from the illness caused by the coronavirus, including more than 100 newly counted fatalities from probable cases over the past several weeks. The state reported 17 new deaths among confirmed coronavirus cases. The Health Department said it was also adding another 139 deaths from people who tested positive through antigen testing or had COVID-19 listed as a cause of death but did not have lab results confirming it. The latest figures bring Arkansas’ total COVID-19 deaths since the pandemic began in March to 1,149. It’s not clear how far back the probable deaths went, but health officials said they didn’t represent a new increase in COVID-19 fatalities. “We’re concerned about every death, but I don’t see that (virus deaths are) accelerating,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson said. “It’s just simply that we are really accounting for deaths that have come in previously.”
California
San Francisco: A judge on Tuesday ordered classrooms closed at a private school in the Central Valley that has defied state and local health orders aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus. The ruling marked a legal victory for Fresno County health officials, who had unsuccessfully ordered Immanuel Schools last month to stop in-person instruction. The K-12 Christian school, with about 600 students, reopened its campus Aug. 13, saying parents should decide if their children attend school. They also claimed that students had achieved herd immunity, based on a sampling of tests done by a parent who is a pathologist. County health officials had argued that the school was threatening the health and safety of students, faculty and community, and they sued the school seeking a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to bar it from holding in-person classes.
Colorado
Boulder: All students at the University of Colorado’s main campus are being told to self-quarantine starting Wednesday for the next two weeks to stem an alarming rise in coronavirus cases. The advisory by Jeffrey J. Zayach, executive director of Boulder County Public Health, came in a letter he sent Tuesday to Boulder campus students, faculty and staff. Zayach warned mandatory restrictions could follow if students do not comply. University officials have reported 13 positive tests the first week of school, 90 the second week and 205 the third week. Most cases involve students who live off campus. Students were asked to stay at home with a few exceptions that include attending class or going to work. Dr. Rachel Herlihy, the state epidemiologist, said Tuesday that there have been six COVID-19 outbreaks at Colorado colleges and universities.
Connecticut
Hartford: The state’s Department of Public Health has decided to close a Norwich nursing home where officials allege violations of COVID-19 protocols have led to several deaths. Acting Commissioner Dr. Deidre Gifford on Monday announced the appointment of a temporary manager to take over operations at the Three Rivers Nursing Home following the investigation of a late July outbreak of COVID-19 in the facility. At least least 21 residents and six staff became infected, and four of those patients have since died. The Health Department determined the facility failed to initially group residents who had tested positive to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 and failed to use personal protective equipment in accordance with federal standards. There were a number of other findings, including failure to maintain a 14-day quarantine for a resident exposed to COVID-19.
Delaware
Wilmington: The state is experiencing its highest rate of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 since mid-July, which officials attribute to an increase of cases among college students. Gov. John Carney announced Tuesday that the state is seeing a seven-day average of 7.1% for the percent of positive cases, when just weeks ago it was hovering around 4%. Health officials consider the positivity rate a key indicator when looking to further reopen the economy and schools. This is the highest the state’s figure has been since July 12, when the average percent positive was 8.1%. Anything over 5% is considered to be concerning, state officials have said. When looking to allow students fully back into the classroom, the state’s percent positive rate will have to be lower than 3%. “We really need to do a better job,” Carney said at his weekly press briefing. “It’s a young adult crowd; it ought to be a responsible crowd.”
District of Columbia
Washington: It could be next summer before the bulk of the D.C. region’s workers return to their offices, according to a recent survey by the Greater Washington Partnership. More than six months after the coronavirus pandemic hit the area, forcing thousands to work from home, many employers remain uncertain when and how they will begin allowing employees back in the office, based on the study, WUSA-TV reports. The study, which surveyed more than 400 employers, shows most companies are struggling with how to safely integrate workers back in the office in the midst of the pandemic. While some companies planned to begin bringing workers back after Labor Day this year, they have changed their plans in response to new cases along with employee concerns of contracting the virus while at work, according to the study.
Florida
Tallahassee: Nearly 400 additional Florida State University students tested positive for COVID-19 last week, according to an update on the university’s dashboard. The figures show that out of 3,063 tests taken last week, 391 students tested positive, along with six employees. That equates to a 12.9% positivity rate for last week’s test results through Sept. 11, according to the university. Since Aug. 2, FSU’s cumulative positivity rate is 8.49%. The latest figures come as the university begins random COVID-19 testing for asymptomatic students, faculty and staff. It also comes on the heels of social media posts over the weekend deploring the lack of enforcement of mask usage by those attending Saturday’s game against Georgia Tech and images of students attending a crowded gathering at off-campus housing without wearing masks or practicing social distancing.
Georgia
Cairo: Grady County has closed its sheriff’s office to outsiders after the 76-year-old sheriff was infected with COVID-19 and hospitalized. The Thomasville Times-Enterprise reports Sheriff Harry Young tested positive for the coronavirus Monday and checked himself into the hospital in Cairo. “My back was hurting real bad, and I thought that probably was what my problem was,” Young said, saying he’s feeling much better. He expects to be discharged by the end of the week but will spend more time at home in isolation. All other sheriff’s office employees were tested after Young’s diagnosis and found to be negative. Still, officials closed the office to visitors. Deputies will continue to respond to calls, and other business will be handled by phone. Young said deputies were already trying to avoid jailing people, except in the cases of the most serious crimes.
Hawaii
Hilo: A new state program providing $100 million of rental assistance to struggling tenants in the state has received more than 6,000 applications. Hawaii’s Rent Relief and Housing Assistance Program began Sept. 8, The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. The program provides rental assistance to residents having difficulty making payments because of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The program is currently set up to provide assistance for rent payments between Aug. 1 and Dec. 28. Denise Iseri-Matsubara, executive director of the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation, said there have been more than 6,000 applicants and many more inquiries by phone and online. “The new website has had over 80,000 hits since it was launched,” Iseri-Matsubara said. The program processed some claims and disbursed funds within the first week of its existence.
Idaho
Boise: A committee helping to oversee the state’s $1.25 billion share of the federal government’s $2.2 trillion coronavirus rescue package on Tuesday approved spending $150 million to help educate students. The Coronavirus Financial Advisory Committee followed Republican Gov. Brad Little’s request from last week and unanimously approved spending $100 million to replace a similar amount cut by Little in 2020 due to pandemic-related budgetary concerns. The committee also unanimously approved spending $50 million to be made available to parents so they’re less likely to leave the workforce or dip into household money while their children learn amid the challenges posed by the pandemic. That money will be distributed based on income and can be used to purchase educational materials, computers and other services.
Illinois
Chicago: City officials cautioned residents Tuesday about travel to Wisconsin, citing a recent COVID-19 spike in Illinois’ neighbor to the north. The Chicago Department of Public Health stopped short of adding Wisconsin to its travel advisory list, which includes 16 states. City officials said Chicago residents who travel to the states must quarantine for two weeks upon return to Chicago. Visitors from those states must do the same. Wisconsin was previously on Chicago’s list in late July and then removed the following month when cases dropped. On Sunday, Wisconsin reported its highest one-day case count with 1,582 new confirmed COVID-19 cases and a 21% positive test rate. Its overall seven-day average for positive test that week was 14%. Meanwhile, Illinois reported 1,466 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday and 20 additional deaths. The state’s seven-day average of positive cases is 3.6%.
Indiana
Indianapolis: Officials are still holding back on spending more than half of the $2.4 billion state government received in federal coronavirus relief funding. Democrats on the State Budget Committee questioned Tuesday why there wasn’t more urgency in spending the money on the immediate needs of people around the state, while Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb’s top budget adviser blamed some of that on confusion over federal rules. State Office of Management and Budget Director Cristopher Johnston presented a report to committee members showing that only $225 million, or less than 10%, of that money had been spent by the end of August. The report showed nearly $1.1 billion in total had been spent or committed toward programs or expenses related to the COVID-19 pandemic that shut down much of Indiana’s economy through the spring and has killed nearly 3,500 people.
Iowa
Des Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds said Tuesday that she’ll let bars, breweries and taverns in four counties reopen, less than three weeks after she order them closed after a surge in coronavirus cases. In a proclamation effective Wednesday, Reynolds said bars may reopen in Black Hawk, Dallas, Linn and Polk counties. Restaurants in those counties may also resume serving alcohol without the restrictions she implemented Aug. 27. Bars must remain closed in Johnson and Story counties, where the University of Iowa and Iowa State University are located. Restaurants in those counties must still stop selling alcohol at 10 p.m., according to the new proclamation, which will be effective at least until Sept. 20. Those campus areas have continued to have high virus spread rates that Reynolds has attributed to young adults gathering in bars and other locations without masks or adequate distancing.
Kansas
Lawrence: City officials are looking for ways to put the brakes on house parties in neighborhoods near the University of Kansas campus as the number of COVID-19 cases among students continues to rise. After a debate during the Lawrence City Commission meeting Tuesday, a majority of the commissioners said they were interested in at least considering an ordinance that would make it a municipal offense to violate local health orders designed to stem the spread of the coronavirus, the Lawrence Journal-World reports. The discussion came as the the university announced that the total number of COVID-19 cases has risen to 841, an increase of 42 cases since Friday, the paper reports. Multiple house parties also were reported over the weekend. City Attorney Toni Wheeler said the offense would be a misdemeanor that could be prosecuted in municipal court. Violators could face a fine of no more than $500, up to 30 days in jail or both.
Kentucky
Louisville: Gov. Andy Beshear announced 745 new coronavirus cases Tuesday with nine additional deaths. Though the state’s positivity rate has slipped below 4%, the Democratic governor urged Kentuckians to stay vigilant by wearing a mask and practicing social distancing. He also declared that the last call for bars and restaurants has been extended to 11 p.m., an hour later than previous guidance. This change will allow the businesses to stay open through televised sports games, though they will be required to be closed down by midnight. “Folks, remember that while we have a positivity rate going the right way, we have still a significant number of cases,” Beshear said. “If we can keep it up, we can do even better.” The positivity rate is an indicator of the extent of the spread of the virus, according to the World Health Organization. If the rate is less than 5% for two weeks, and testing is widespread, the virus is considered under control.
Louisiana
Baton Rouge: The Louisiana State University football team had a covert COVID-19 outbreak over the summer. “I think most – not all of our players – but most of our players have caught it,” LSU coach Ed Orgeron revealed Tuesday on a teleconference. “So I think hopefully they don’t catch it again, and hopefully they’re not out for games.” Initially a spike of 30 or more cases was reported in June, and there were a few other cases reported here and there throughout the summer. “Two weeks ago, everybody on our offensive line except two or three guys were out,” Orgeron said Tuesday. “We adjusted very well.” Orgeron did not say what led to the outbreak, but LSU had an outbreak of 30 or more football players getting the virus last June after many of the players visited the Tigerland bars near campus.
Maine
Augusta: The state’s first jury trial since March has been postponed because the child of a key witness has symptoms consistent with the coronavirus. Maine hasn’t held criminal jury trials in six months due to the pandemic. The judiciary scheduled three trials this month as pilots. Two are in Augusta, and one is in Bangor. The first trial, scheduled to start Tuesday, concerned a defendant charged with misdemeanor operating under the influence. However, a police officer who was a key witness contacted the prosecutor to say his child got sick at day care and needed to be tested for the virus, the Portland Press Herald reports. A judge held a hearing Monday and decided to postpone the trial until the spring. Courts have two other trials scheduled for next week. Maine has had more than 4,900 cases of the virus.
Maryland
Annapolis: Lawmakers and health care advocates proposed increasing the state’s alcohol tax Wednesday to generate millions of dollars to address health disparities, which have been highlighted by the coronavirus pandemic. Supporters are backing a hike in the state’s sales tax on alcohol from 9% to 10% in 2021. Maryland last raised its sales tax on alcohol in 2011. “The COVID pandemic has made it even more clear that certain communities, especially communities of color, do not have the health care resources they need, which leads to disturbing health disparities,” said Sen. Antonio Hayes, a Baltimore Democrat who is sponsoring the measure in the state Senate. Under the proposal, areas with health disparities would be able to compete for grants and tax incentives. The majority-black Prince George’s County has had more than 28,000 confirmed cases – the highest number in a Maryland county – and seen at least 791 deaths.
Massachusetts
Boston: Restaurants are now being allowed to offer outdoor dining in public spaces well into the onset of cold weather. The city’s outdoor dining season, designed to boost business during the coronavirus pandemic, had been scheduled to end Oct. 31 but has been extended until Dec. 1, Mayor Marty Walsh announced Tuesday. “Restaurants have faced incredible challenges during this ongoing public health crisis, and the City of Boston is committed to helping them survive and succeed, including by giving restaurants more flexibility around outdoor dining,” Walsh said in a statement. To help keep al fresco diners stay warm as the weather cools, the city will also waive application fees for permits for outdoor propane heaters.
Michigan
Allendale: Students at Grand Valley State University were ordered Wednesday to hunker down for two weeks due to a spike in coronavirus cases linked to the western Michigan campus. There have been more than 600 cases of COVID-19 among students since Aug. 23, with the majority among students living off campus, Ottawa County health officials said. The stay-in-place order starts Thursday. Students must stick to their on-campus or off-campus residence unless attending classes, exercising, getting food, seeking health care or working at an essential job. Students cannot return to their home community unless there’s an emergency. “We need students to take the … order seriously and be vigilant to help stop the spread of COVID-19,” said Dr. Paul Heidel, the county’s medical director. GVSU athletes can practice sports if a doctor is present, though the health department is “strongly” discouraging it.
Minnesota
Minneapolis: Gov. Tim Walz urged the campaigns of President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden on Tuesday to abide by the state’s guidelines for slowing the spread of the coronavirus when the candidates visit Minnesota on Friday. “Partner with us in the fight against COVID-19,” the Democratic governor said in a letter to both campaigns. Trump may be running as the “law and order” candidate, but that hasn’t stopped him and his campaign from openly defying state emergency orders and flouting his own administration’s guidelines as he holds rallies in battleground states. Trump has an airport rally scheduled for Friday in the north-central Minnesota city of Bemidji. Biden’s campaign has not yet announced a city or venue for his visit. Walz said Minnesota requires face masks inside public places and strongly encourages them for outdoor gatherings.
Mississippi
Canton: A central Mississippi flea market is scheduled to happen next month, despite a mayor’s attempt to stop it because of COVID-19 safety concerns. The Canton Board of Aldermen voted unanimously Monday to overturn Mayor William Truly’s veto of the Canton Flea Market, WLBT-TV reports. The event is usually held twice a year on the town square in Canton, about 35 miles north of Jackson. Officials canceled the one in May because of the pandemic. The next one is Oct. 8. The flea market typically attracts thousands of shoppers to the small town. Although the event is outside, it’s common to see people crowded close together. Aldermen say they are working on a safety plan that includes requiring all vendors and shoppers to wear masks. They are asking all vendors to have hand sanitizer at each booth, and there are plans for handwashing stations throughout the square.
Missouri
Columbia: With more than 1,300 of its students infected with the coronavirus, the University of Missouri said Tuesday that two students were expelled and three others suspended for violating rules meant to slow the virus’s spread. A news release said the sanctions were necessary because of flagrant violations of rules and regulations that require students who test positive for the coronavirus to isolate themselves and comply with social distancing requirements. University System President and MU Chancellor Mun Choi said the university has repeatedly stressed the importance of COVID-19 policies and regulations aimed at keeping students, faculty, staff and the community safe. “We have seen a strong adoption of our policies and regulations,” Choi said in the release. “Unfortunately, a few students have violated these policies and violated the trust of their fellow community members.”
Montana
Great Falls: The state added 190 cases of COVID-19 early Wednesday, bringing its total to 9,431 confirmations of the respiratory illness. Of the 9,431, 7,186 are recovered, and 2,104 are active, the state said on its covid19.mt.gov website. Montana has tallied 141 deaths, one more than reported Tuesday. The newest death occurred in Gallatin County, state officials said. The state has 106 people hospitalized out of 543 total hospitalizations since the pandemic began. There have been 292,401 tests administered, 2,035 more than Tuesday. Cascade County Sheriff Jesse Slaughter said Sunday that there were 37 new COVID-19 positive cases at the county’s detention center. He said that makes for a total of 60 active inmate cases and 70 inmates who have recovered.
Nebraska
Lincoln: Three more state corrections employees have tested positive for the coronavirus, state prisons officials said over the weekend. An employee at the Nebraska State Penitentiary in Lincoln and two employees at the state Diagnostic and Evaluation Center are the latest to test positive for COVID-19, the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services said in a news release Saturday. With the new cases, a total of 85 state prisons workers across the state have tested positive for the virus. Sixty-three of those have recovered. Officials said anyone who had close contact with the ill employees would be notified and directed to quarantine until they are cleared by a doctor. The agency said on its website that 184 inmates across the state had tested positive for the coronavirus as of Friday. Officials said 126 of those positive cases have been found at the State Penitentiary in Lincoln.
Nevada
Carson City: Lawmakers allocated $6.2 million in federal relief dollars to a program that will test thousands of teachers across the state as they return to classrooms for in-person instruction. The program will pay for personnel, test kits, test processing and surveillance for up to 62,500 teachers and support staff throughout Nevada. It will be administered by the Clark County Teacher’s Health Trust, the largest public school employee health plan in the state. Throughout the United States, coronavirus cases have spiked in school districts that have opened for in-person instruction, including in Washoe County, where students and teachers at 16 schools in the Reno area have tested positive for the virus since returning to classrooms in mid-August. The district has made free testing available to teachers through the Renown Health hospital network.
New Hampshire
Concord: The Salvation Army is planning to start its Red Kettle campaign earlier this year – in November – because of the need caused by the coronavirus pandemic, and people won’t need change or cash in hand to donate. “We’re going to have a code right on the kettle so that people can just take their phone and scan it, so it’s simple and easy,” Rosemarie Dykeman of the Salvation Army of Greater Nashua told WMUR-TV. People also can text “Kettles” to 91999 and fill in the amount. The Salvation Army of Northern New England said it could end up serving many more families this Christmas. In 2019, 553 families were served; this year, it estimates the number to be 857 families. “We’re getting a lot of new families that have lost a job due to the pandemic or the fact that their hours have been cut,” Dykeman said.
New Jersey
Menlo Park: More than 100 veterans, health care workers and relatives of residents who died of COVID-19 rallied outside the state-run veterans home in the city Wednesday, demanding an investigation and the resignation of local managers. Families and union members said management’s orders to stop wearing face masks during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic led the Edison Township facility to amass one of the worst death tolls among nursing homes in New Jersey. “You couldn’t have prevented COVID, but you could have prevented it from becoming a wildfire,” said Shirley Suddoth-Lewis, president of the local chapter of AFSCME, the union representing nurses aides and other workers. Sixty-two residents and one caregiver have died since the start of the pandemic at the 312-bed home. Another state-run veterans center in Paramus leads all nursing homes in the state with 81 residents and one staff member lost.
New Mexico
Santa Fe: A special audit of management contracts is raising concerns about weak financial controls, executive compensation excesses and potential profiteering at a county-owned hospital on the edge of the Navajo Reservation that became overwhelmed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The state auditor’s office on Tuesday released results for the Rehoboth McKinley Christian hospital in Gallup and its management and service contracts dating to 2016. The audit delves into a five-year contract for management of the hospital by the company Healthcare Integrity, whose CEO David Conejo came under criticism in public protests in May as the hospital grappled with coronavirus infections among staff. It resorted to transferring acute COVID-19 patients to other hospitals. Conejo was fired by the hospital in June.
New York
New York: The city’s already-delayed school year started remotely Wednesday in a soft opening that will serve as a prologue to the return of students to actual classrooms next week. Even as more than a million kids remotely return to class, it’s an open question whether the city can pull off the hybrid learning system Mayor Bill de Blasio announced in July. Unions representing teachers and principals in the nation’s largest public school district say schools still don’t have the teachers or the coronavirus safety measures that are needed, but de Blasio, a Democrat, insisted that the school year would start as planned with three days of online orientation this week. Students began returning to physical classrooms Wednesday for the first time since March. New York City is one of only a few large U.S. cities attempting to start the school year with students in real classrooms.
North Carolina
Raleigh: The state government is using federal COVID-19 relief dollars to purchase equipment so more public school students can access online classes and homework help. Gov. Roy Cooper announced last week that nearly $40 million would go toward funding a new partnership involving his administration. The project, called NC Student Connect, is designed to improve reliable internet for children as they learn remotely this fall due to coronavirus restrictions. About $30 million will go toward the purchase and distribution of 100,000 wireless, high-speed hot spots for students, Cooper’s office said in a news release. Another $8 million will provide free high-speed internet in public locations like parking lots so students can drop by to download class lessons. Other money will help instruct teachers, parents and students about remote learning techniques.
North Dakota
Bismarck: State health officials on Wednesday reported 269 new COVID-19 cases and five more deaths related to the coronavirus, including two in Burleigh County and two in Eddy County. The other death was in McLean County. The state has recorded 172 deaths since the pandemic began, which is the 46th-most in the country overall and the 37th-highest per capita, according to the COVID Tracking Project. But the volunteer organization ranks North Dakota No. 1 overall in the number of cases per capita in the past two weeks. Officials confirmed cases in 35 counties in the last day, led by Cass County with 80, Williams County with 49, Burleigh County with 17 and Ward County with 13. There were no other counties with cases in double figures. The number of active cases in the state dropped by 36, to 2,528. The number of hospitalizations remained unchanged at 62.
Ohio
Columbus: The state will be able to hire a health director despite concerns about criticism a candidate might face, Gov. Mike DeWine said Tuesday, addressing last week’s turn of events during which his new director withdrew her name just five hours after it was announced. DeWine said he respected the decision by former South Carolina Health Director Dr. Joan Duwve to reject the job Sept. 10. She cited unspecified personal reasons, then issued a statement the next day saying she learned the previous health director’s family had been harassed by the public. Dr. Amy Acton abruptly resigned as health director in June following a torrent of conservative criticism over her public health orders to slow the spread of the pandemic. That included armed protesters outside her house and protests outside the Ohio Statehouse with signs bearing anti-Semitic messages. Acton is Jewish.
Oklahoma
Oklahoma City: The city’s children will return to the classroom part time in mid-October or early November, depending on their grade, under a plan adopted by the school board in the state’s largest district. Under the plan agreed to Tuesday night, pre-K and kindergarten students will get two days per week of in-person instruction and three days of virtual classes starting Oct. 19. “These children are least familiar with a school setting and have some of the greatest challenges in a virtual setting, so this plan will give them a chance to acclimate before the rest of the students arrive,” Superintendent Sean McCasland said in a statement. Half of the students will attend in-person classes on Mondays and Tuesdays, and the other half will do so on Thursdays and Fridays. All students will receive remote instruction on Wednesdays. Students will have their temperatures checked each day and be encouraged to wear masks.
Oregon
Salem: On the eve of the first day of school, parents and educators reported districtwide technical issues with some of Salem-Keizer Public Schools’ new remote learning platforms. Class rosters were not loading Wednesday, and some students still didn’t have login credentials. Educators were still receiving training on how to run the systems. and crafting curricula. Some still didn’t know which classes or grades they will teach. Parents were still attempting to set up the new apps, secure needed technology and reassure their children. With the COVID-19 pandemic and Oregon wildfires in the background, families and educators in Salem-Keizer schools are beginning the new year amid confusion, chaos and, for some, traumatic loss. Wednesday ran on a modified schedule, similar to a soft opening, with all students but kindergarteners expected to start their full-day schedule Thursday.
Pennsylvania
Harrisburg: The state House on Tuesday passed a bill that would prevent governors from applying their disease control powers to shut down gatherings at churches or other houses of worship. The chamber voted 149 to 53 for the proposal, which the Democratic leader called a solution in search of a problem. All Republicans voted for it, while Democrats were split fairly evenly. “There’s never been a closure, and there won’t be,” Minority Leader Frank Dermody, D-Allegheny, said during floor debate. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf and authorities under him have not restricted religious gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic. Instead, he asked religious leaders to protect their congregants. Wolf’s stay-at-home order effectively exempted religious activity but strongly discouraged gatherings. The proposal was sent to the Senate for its consideration.
Rhode Island
Providence: Providence College students who live off campus have been asked to stick to remote-only classes for the time being after several tested positive for COVID-19, school officials say. Off-campus students are only allowed to visit campus for testing, the school said Tuesday. “We have received reports of students who have tested for COVID-19 tests on their own, at off-campus facilities. Some of these results have been reported to the college by the Rhode Island Department of Health; others have been self-reported,” Steven Sears, interim vice president for student affairs and dean of students, said in a message to off-campus students. Off-campus students must learn remotely until they can produce a negative test result, he said. The school said as of Tuesday, 22 students and one faculty member or staffer had tested positive for the disease.
South Carolina
Columbia: The state Senate passed changes Tuesday to the budget that would provide a small raise to most teachers and a hazard pay bonus for some lower-paid state workers. Now attention turns to the House, where leaders may prefer not to change the $9 billion budget at all with worries that COVID-19 could continue to hobble the economy and cut state revenues. Lawmakers have already agreed to keep spending levels for the budget year that started in July at the same levels as the year before. The Senate also approved how it thinks South Carolina should spend the remaining $668 million in federal money for COVID-19 expenses, including setting aside $425 million toward repaying the fund that doles out unemployment benefits. The state has already set aside $500 million in federal money to replenish that fund.
South Dakota
Sioux Falls: Eight additional people with COVID-19 have died, the state Department of Health reported Wednesday – a single-day record that brought the death toll from the coronavirus to 192. South Dakota also reported its single largest day of test results. The 5,690 results detected 297 new infections, for a daily positive rate of 5.22%. The total number of South Dakotans reported with the disease was 17,291. Sixty-eight of the new cases were in the higher-risk population of people older than 60. Fifty-four were among those 20-29, while 40 were in those 10-19. The age group with the smallest number of infections was 0-9, with eight positive cases.
Tennessee
Nashville: The nearly decadelong climb of the state’s graduate rate lost ground during the 2019-20 school year amid a turbulent school year thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic. About 89.6% of public high school seniors earned their diplomas at the end of the 2019-20 school year, a slight dip from the 89.7% rate set during the 2018-19 school year. Though the rate is down by one-tenth of a percentage point this year, the state has seen a steady increase since changes were made in 2011. Education Commissioner Penny Schwinn lauded last year’s record-high rate set by the Class of 2019 and said at the time she believed the state could top results. With most schools across the state closing by April because of the pandemic, many high school seniors missed the last months of the school year, but the state relaxed graduation requirements to ensure seniors weren’t negatively affected by the sudden disruption to the school year.
Texas
Dallas: State health officials on Tuesday reported 4,816 new cases of the coronavirus and 132 additional deaths. The total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state is now 668,746, while the death toll stands at 14,343, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. The true number of cases in Texas is likely higher, though, because many people haven’t been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. Health officials estimate nearly 68,500 cases in the state are active. There were about 3,300 people with COVID-19 hospitalized in Texas on Tuesday, health officials said. The number of hospitalizations has been decreasing since peaking July 22 at 10,893.
Utah
Salt Lake City: State officials say the U.S. Postal Service has sent erroneous information to voters about the upcoming election, decreasing public confidence in the service’s ability to handle ballots this year. The office of Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox said the Postal Service mailed a postcard to homes across the state last week urging voters “to request your mail-in ballot … at least 15 days before Election Day,” The Salt Lake Tribune reports. “All active registered voters in Utah automatically receive their ballots in the mail. Individuals do not need to request a mail-in ballot separately if they have previously registered to vote,” Cox said, arguing that the postcard’s information did not apply in Utah. State officials have encouraged methods other than voting on Election Day to reduce crowds and limit the risk of spreading COVID-19.
Vermont
St. Johnsbury: The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted the town to cancel its annual Halloween parade. Organizer Diane Cummings told the town select board Monday that the parade brings at least 3,000 people onto the streets of the community. The Caledonian Record reports she said the committee plans to let people know about the cancellation. “We were thinking of hanging skeletons along Main Street – maybe a dozen holding signs saying something like ‘Boo-Hoo, No Parade This Year’ or something corny like that,” she said. But Cummings said the committee is still determined to do something special for Halloween. One idea is to provide Halloween candy to children through the St. Johnsbury schools. All pandemic precautions would be followed while the candy is prepared for distribution, Cummings said. Other ideas the committee is working on include a pumpkin carving and scarecrow competitions.
Virginia
Richmond: Gov. Ralph Northam is trying to reassure Virginians that voting by mail is safe and that election security is a top priority for the state. The Democratic governor made the comments Tuesday while highlighting steps the state is taking to protect absentee voting during the coronavirus pandemic, which include using drop boxes for early voting and putting barcodes on absentee ballot envelopes to track when they are delivered. “We all share the priority of ensuring free and fair elections,” Northam said. Virginia is one of several states offering ways for voters to verify the status of their ballot online. The Virginia Department of Elections’ citizen portal shows when an absentee ballot request has been received, when a ballot has been sent and when the ballot has been received by a local election office. Lawmakers also recently approved Northam’s proposal to spend $2 million for prepaid postage for all absentee ballots.
Washington
Mount Vernon: The Skagit County Department of Emergency Management in northwest Washington state has provided about 2,000 N95 masks to protect agricultural workers amid the widespread wildfires, officials said. Thick smoke has made the air quality unhealthy and prompted orders for citizens to stay home as much as possible. The smoke is expected to linger until at least Thursday, the Skagit Valley Herald reports, but area farmers cannot halt all of their outdoor work. Farmers and farmworkers were already required to wear face coverings because of the coronavirus, but cloth masks do little to protect from wildfire pollutants, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Masks like the N95 can protect against harmful particles found in smoke.
West Virginia
Charleston: State officials yet again amended guidelines for reopening schools Tuesday, with the aim of restarting in-person instruction and sports in more counties. The changes add a new category to the state’s color-coded coronavirus map, which rates the severity of the outbreak in counties. Critics and education groups say multiple tweaks to the map over several weeks have confused parents and school officials. Republican Gov. Jim Justice and his advisers unveiled the new gold category after an hourslong meeting Monday evening. Five counties can now resume in-person instruction and sports competitions after moving from orange to gold. The West Virginia Education Association, which has about 15,000 members, slammed the rollout. “We are angry that our state leaders continue to manipulate the color-coded map,” Dale Lee, president of the association, said in a statement.
Wisconsin
Madison: University of Wisconsin-Madison officials made the right decision to reopen the campus even though there’s been a surge of COVID-19 cases there, Gov. Tony Evers said Tuesday. The state’s flagship university reopened Sept. 2. As of Tuesday, 2,160 students and 31 university workers have tested positive for COVID-19. The university has been forced to suspend in-person classes in lieu of online instruction and quarantine multiple fraternity and sorority houses as well as two large dorms. Chancellor Rebecca Blank, who has blamed the outbreak on student actions, has been intensely criticized for opening the campus for the fall semester after other colleges across the country that opened earlier saw similar outbreaks. Evers, a Democrat, defended the decision, saying the reopening came with a massive effort to test students and trace infected students’ contacts. Students should take more responsibility for their behavior, he said.
Wyoming
Cheyenne: About 100 students at a junior high school have been told to stay home after a school employee tested positive for the coronavirus. The positive case at McCormick Junior High School announced Tuesday was the first in the Cheyenne-area school district since school began Aug. 31. School officials were ready to offer remote instruction for students who needed it, Laramie County School District No. 1 Superintendent Boyd Brown told the Wyoming Tribune Eagle. Brown declined to say whether the employee testing positive was a teacher but said at least one other McCormick employee was potentially in contact with that person. “That may require them to be quarantined, as well, but if they’re just quarantined and able to teach, we’ll just have them do that remotely,” Brown said. The school has about 600 students.

110,https://dailyfreepress.com/2020/09/17/experts-discuss-covid-19-and-its-consequences/,0.421,Experts discuss COVID-19 and its consequences,"From Boston to Hong Kong, some of the greatest minds in public health gathered virtually on Tuesday to discuss the science behind COVID-19 to an audience of students whose lives have already been reshaped by the ongoing public health crisis.
Researchers and health experts shared their understanding of the causes as well as the present and future states of COVID-19 in a Zoom seminar entitled “COVID-19: State of the Science,” hosted by Boston University’s School of Public Health.
Four speakers each gave a presentation on their distinct field, and SPH professor David Hamer moderated a Q-and-A session. Hamer said in an interview before the panel that the purpose of this forum was to examine the disease through a variety of expert lenses.
“We’re trying to have a balance of different kinds of people that can discuss different aspects of the disease and the epidemic,” Hamer said. “It’s a high-level view of what we’ve learned about COVID-19 during the last six to nine months since the pandemic started.”
Hallie Prescott, an associate professor at the University of Michigan, discussed the severity of COVID-19 and some of the biologic mechanisms behind acute illnesses. Her presentation also centered around post-pandemic ailments.
“For the people who get COVID and survive,” Prescott said in an interview before the panel, “there’s a lot of people who are having lasting issues or slow, longer term recoveries.”
Gabriel Leung, dean of medicine at the University of Hong Kong, focused his presentation on the epidemiology of the disease. Drawing on his previous experience with the 2003 SARS outbreak, Leung said his research examines the cluster, or “clumpiness,” effect of the pandemic.
“SARS 1 was very clumpy,” Leung said during the discussion. “In fact, the term ‘super-spreading event’ really got popularized through that epidemiological investigation of SARS 1.”
SARS 2 is better known as COVID-19, Leung said, and Hong Kong’s biggest clusters emerged from social settings like bars and weddings.
Gabriela Gomes, a professor of mathematics and statistics at the University of Strathclyde Glasgow, focused on the mathematical trends behind the spread of COVID-19 in different geographic areas and according to population susceptibility.
Gomes spoke about the future of her models of immunity in heterogeneous communities, saying that she sees a possible development of their use throughout the world.
“Non-pharmaceutical interventions have a large impact in reducing the impact of this first encounter with the virus,” Gomes said. “And then you see what we projected for England, Portugal and Spain.”
Panelist Caitlin Rivers, an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, shared a public policy approach and spoke about creating a research and development program for various aspects of the medical response to COVID-19.
Rivers spoke about the U.S. response to the onset of the pandemic and noted the lack of interventions such as testing, contact tracing and isolation policies.
“We were severely constrained in our ability to test people for the virus,” Rivers said. “In the slow rollout of the diagnostic capacity, we really missed the window to be able to control the outbreak through case-based interventions.”
SPH graduate student Walae Hayek said she felt the seminar was useful and informative to the BU student population.
“I think that it’s a great community forum,” Hayek said, “so that people can be updated and people can understand exactly what’s going on in terms of what we’re doing as a school and what we’re doing as part of the community.”
Hayek said she believes it is the duty of BU’s student population to be aware of their impact on the surrounding city.
“I think, as students, that we should be responsible … for what we’re doing in the communities,” Hayek said. “We are a part of the Greater Boston area and so we have a responsibility that we’re protecting not just ourselves.”"
111,https://www.mprnews.org/story/2020/09/17/latest-on-covid19-in-mn,-1.613,Sept. 17 update on COVID-19 in MN: School guidance map shifts again,"Updated: 3 p.m.
Minnesota’s yo-yoing COVID-19 case numbers in recent weeks have meant some drastic swings in school districts’ safe learning recommendations, but state health officials say they’re taking the data irregularities into account when working with schools to set learning plans.
A formula produced by the Health Department generates guidance for districts to help decide whether to have in-person learning, distance learning, or a mix, based on the rate of COVID-19 cases in that district’s county over a two-week period.
The most recent recommendations, released Thursday, cover cases from Aug. 23 to Sept. 5 — a period that happened to see a late-August spike in new COVID-19 cases.
The result? A full 25 counties saw their COVID-19 case counts slip past one of the health department’s thresholds, changing their recommendation toward more distance learning for more students.
In the most recent update, six counties are recommended to have all students do full-time distance learning: Blue Earth, Lyon, Stevens, Waseca, Winona and Yellow Medicine counties. All but Waseca County were previously recommended to allow at least some in-person learning.
Not every county got worse. Eleven counties saw their case rates improve compared to last week’s results, and saw their recommendation shift to more in-person learning.
You make MPR News possible. Individual donations are behind the clarity in coverage from our reporters across the state, stories that connect us, and conversations that provide perspectives. Help ensure MPR remains a resource that brings Minnesotans together.
Overall, 24 largely rural counties have a recommendation of in-person for all students.
These recommendations are only considered the starting point for school districts, which make their own learning plans in cooperation with the Health Department.
Because Minnesota’s calculation uses weeks-old data and calculates cases by the day a person got tested rather than the day the tests were reported, this update is not affected by recent reporting delays caused by the Labor Day weekend.
Big jump in daily case counts, testing
The new school guidance map came out the same day officials unveiled their coming monthlong push to boost testing in selected regions around the state to curb community spread of the coronavirus.
The Health Department is “deeply concerned” about the jump in community spread across Minnesota — cases where people don’t know how they contracted the disease, said Dan Huff, an assistant state health commissioner, as he explained the need to boost testing efforts.
Minnesota is seeing cases leap in neighboring states, he added, and “we do not want that to happen here.”
Officials are also pushing ahead on education and enforcement efforts to ensure restaurant owners and patrons comply with the state’s masking and social distancing orders. Huff said that investigators want compliance in the “most unobtrusive way possible” but that owners and customers had a responsibility to follow the rules.
“This is a serious disease. We know that,” he said. “There’s no vaccine. There’s no cure, and it’s contagious. Everyone needs to do their part.”
Thursday’s COVID-19 daily data report showed 931 new confirmed infections in Minnesota, one of the high single-day reports in the pandemic. But that came along with big testing numbers, suggesting this case spike may be largely due to more testing rather than greater community spread.
Two other closely watched metrics — the number of people currently hospitalized (242) and patients needing intensive care (132) inched downward from Wednesday, part of a downward trend in those cases since the start of September and far lower than their late-May peaks.
Of the 86,722 confirmed cases of the disease in the pandemic as of Thursday, about 92 percent of those infected have recovered to the point they no longer need to be isolated.
Nine more deaths brought Minnesota’s toll to 1,942. Among those who’ve died, about 73 percent had been living in long-term care or assisted living facilities; nearly all had underlying health problems.
‘This is not a cold’
Among their worries this week, health officials have also expressed unease about the possible resumption of football and other fall sports in the pandemic.
Minnesota has seen more than 1,400 cases of COVID-19 tied to sports activities in the pandemic, including nearly 900 in adults. Collectively, that caseload has led to recommended quarantines for more than 3,300 people.
“This is not a cold,” Dr. Ruth Lynfield, the state’s epidemiologist, warned of COVID-19. “There are some people who do fine with this, but there are others, including young people, who do not do fine.”
She noted studies showing heart and other health problems linked to COVID-19 that appear to linger beyond the infection.
“We really don’t have a sense of all the things this virus can do,” she said.
The Big Ten intends to open its season Oct. 23-24. The Minnesota State High School League expects to meet on Monday to review its earlier decision to not play football and volleyball this fall in the face of COVID-19.
While youth and college sports are important, COVID-19 poses a risk to student athletes as well as to the universe of coaches, friends and families that surround players, top state health officials said.
The Health Department was “watching with concern” the rapid growth in new COVID-19 confirmed cases in the states surrounding Minnesota and bracing for potential higher daily case counts from over the Labor Day weekend, when people ventured out for informal get-togethers with family and friends, Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said earlier this week.
The state saw a jump in cases following the July Fourth holiday. Officials also worry about a one-two punch this fall and winter from COVID-19 and the typical flu season.
On Thursday, Malcolm and Kris Ehresmann, the state’s infectious disease director, said it will take about two more weeks to determine if Labor Day gatherings led to a surge in cases.
Health Department investigators this week also going door-to-door in randomly selected neighborhoods in the Twin Cities and southeastern Minnesota as part of a statewide study to find out where COVID-19 is more prevalent.
They’ll ask questions about where people spend time, whether anyone in the house has been diagnosed with COVID-19, and what information they'd like about the virus. They'll also offer free nasal swabs and serology tests.
College campus worries rise
People in their 20s make up the age bracket with the state’s largest number of confirmed cases — topping 20,000 since the pandemic began, including more than 11,500 infections among people ages 20-24.
The numbers help explain why experts remain particularly concerned about young adults as spreaders of the virus.
While less likely to feel the worst effects of the disease, experts worry youth and young adults will spread it to grandparents and other vulnerable populations and could also hamper attempts to reopen campuses completely to in-person teaching.
They’ve been driving the recent outbreaks, although the number of high school-age children confirmed with the disease has also grown, approaching nearly 8,000 total cases for children 15 to 19 years old since the pandemic began.
On Sunday, just across the border from Minnesota, the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse responded to rising cases by moving all in-person classes online, closing dining halls and most campus buildings, and mandating face coverings at all times on campus, indoors or outdoors.
Winona State University is in the middle of a 14-day campus quarantine that will limit all nonessential activities on campus to slow the spread of COVID-19. Winona State on Wednesday reported a current total of 125 active positive cases and 294 since late August.
Winona State, Concordia College in Moorhead and Minnesota State University Mankato have each seen more than 100 cases tied to the schools and students in the last two weeks, Ehresmann said this week.
Regionally, southern and central Minnesota and the Twin Cities suburbs have driven much of the increase in new cases while Hennepin and Ramsey counties show some of the slowest case growth in the state.
Hot spots have included southwestern Minnesota, where 75 cases have been traced to a late-August wedding in Lyon County that officials describe now as the state’s largest single social spreader event.
On Monday, Minnesota officials also confirmed an outbreak of 122 cases at the federal women’s prison in Waseca, which they said began when federal authorities transferred people into the facility from outside the state who had COVID-19.
Developments around the state
Mayo Clinic introduces new coronavirus tracking tool
Mayo Clinic has launched a new COVID-19 case tracker. The online tool will breakdown coronavirus cases by county across 50 states and Washington, D.C.
The tool is aimed at helping people see emerging hot spots — information that can inform decisions about travel, and the safety of friends and family.
The tool includes total cases in each county and state, but also new cases, positive test rates, fatality rates and overall trends.
The data behind the new site is based on Mayo Clinic's own internal COVID-19 modeling tool, which it has used to predict how and where the virus will spread.

Two GOP state lawmakers call on Walz to ease up on businesses
Two Republican state lawmakers are criticizing DFL Gov. Tim Walz over his administration’s enforcement of COVID-19 restrictions.
Reps. Dave Baker, of Willmar, and Tony Jurgens, of Cottage Grove, say state inspectors are imposing stiff fines on restaurants and other hospitality businesses. They highlighted a Hastings restaurant Tuesday that is currently contesting $7,600 in fines, which were largely due to an employee removing a face mask while talking to customers.
The Busted Nut’s owner, Tatia Nelson said it was an isolated incident, and she believes the fine is excessive.
“I’m just trying to do my best as a business, and I’m trying to do everything right,” she said.
Jurgens said the stepped-up enforcement appears to be a change in the administration’s approach.
“When many of these executive orders were issued, the governor indicated that the purpose was to educate, not punish,” Jurgens said. “I believe I even remember somebody saying to hand out masks, not fines. But unfortunately, that’s not the reality.”
Baker, a former restaurant owner, called on the governor to ease up on enforcement. He also urged Walz to allow more indoor seating in restaurants before colder weather hits.

Over the summer, as cases peaked in many areas of the country, many schools opted against welcoming students back to campus for the 2020-2021 academic year. However, in early August, many universities around the country did reopen and in the last several weeks there have been numerous large outbreaks across the country linked to these schools, and students have even been suspended for engaging in risky coronavirus behavior. And, even scarier, according to a new analysis of data, the majority of the large coronavirus outbreaks in the country are centralized in college towns.
USA Today analyzed data from Johns Hopkins University, finding that of the 25 hottest outbreaks in the country, “communities heavy with college students” (aka big college towns) represent 19 of these outbreak areas. To identify the hottest spots they looked at those regions with the highest number of per capita infection rates in the country — 1,053 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people in the last two weeks.
According to their findings, the 25 communities with the most COVID-19 cases per capita during the past two weeks are listed here alongside the college or university situated in the area, if any. As you can see, the majority of the list includes college campuses.

Harrisonburg, Virginia — home of James Madison University — is currently leading the pack of the nation’s most significant outbreaks. According to USA Today, in just one week of classes, the college recorded over 700 COVID cases. On September 1 they changed course, pivoting to online instruction. However, the damage was done. In July, coronavirus infections in the city amounted to just 71 cases per 100,000 in July, and thanks to the school reopening, Harrisonburg is currently dealing with 1,562 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 — an overwhelming jump.

York County remains the hotspot of COVID-19 infection in Maine, with 11 new cases Wednesday among the 25 reported statewide, prompting another southern Maine college to beef up its testing program to protect students and staff.
The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention also reported an outbreak of four cases Wednesday at Elks Lodge 1470 in Sanford, where the state is already investigating outbreaks at four other social clubs.
“Investigations of epidemiological links is ongoing, as some individuals went to more than one of the clubs for which outbreak investigations have been opened,” Maine CDC spokesman Robert Long said in an email.
In response to the conditions in York County, the University of New England announced additional testing measures on its Biddeford and Portland campuses.
“We are asking any students who have found themselves in a situation in which they might have been at higher risk for contracting the virus to voluntarily go to the Student Health Center on either campus to be tested. The tests will be free of charge, and all students – undergraduate and graduate – are encouraged to take advantage of this resource without repercussions,” UNE President James Herbert said in a letter to the university community.
The examples include attending any gathering – such as a party, religious services or other social event – where masking or physical distancing was not consistently maintained, travel to states that require a COVID-19 test upon return to Maine, and close contact with someone who could be COVID-19 positive.
“Students who volunteer for such testing will be granted immunity from any potential conduct violations related to the activity that puts them at increased risk,” Herbert wrote.
UNE’s approach differs from the disciplinary actions many colleges are taking when students violate pandemic protocols.
Sarah Delage, UNE spokeswoman, said there is currently one active case of a student with COVID-19, and that the student “is likely to have contracted the virus out of state.”
UNE’s announcement comes a day after the University of Maine System said it would do additional testing and screening at its schools in southern Maine, including 400 tests at the University of Southern Maine’s Portland and Gorham campuses, and at the University of Maine School of Law in Portland.
The University of Maine System reported no active cases Tuesday. Testing and screening of students as they returned to campus in August resulted in 13 positive tests out of nearly 15,000 tests given.
Meanwhile, at St. Joseph’s College of Maine in Standish, nine cases of COVID-19 were reported over the weekend. Students are being told to “study in place” and remain in their rooms as much as possible over at least the next two weeks, and classes will be conducted remotely. College officials did not respond to messages Wednesday asking about an update on the COVID-19 cases.
The daily case numbers Wednesday from the Maine CDC also include one death.
The death was announced Tuesday by Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine CDC, as being one of the seven deaths associated with an Aug. 7 wedding and reception in the Millinocket area. Six of those who died lived at Maplecrest Rehabilitation and Living Center in Madison, and all of the deaths were secondary infections. None of the people who died attended the wedding or the reception.
Shah expressed concerns about worsening infection trends on Tuesday, especially in York County, the site of several outbreaks. The seven-day average of daily new cases has increased from 25 on Sept. 8 to 30.2 on Tuesday.
The case counts at Sanford social clubs were updated Wednesday by the Maine CDC and now stand at 12 cases at American Legion Post 19, eight cases at the Amvets post, 10 cases at the Lafayette Social Club and 10 cases at Sanford Veterans of Foreign Wars.
Although the number of active cases statewide dipped from 501 on Tuesday to 496 on Wednesday, active cases overall have been trending higher, up from 423 on Sept. 8. Since the pandemic began, there have been 4,941 cases of COVID-19 in Maine and 138 deaths.
The super-spreading event emanating from the wedding and reception in the Millinocket area on Aug. 7 has now sickened 176 people across the state, including a major outbreak at the York County Jail. The pastor who officiated the wedding, Todd Bell, is the pastor at Calvary Baptist Church in Sanford, where 10 people have contracted COVID-19, although the Maine CDC has not established an epidemiological link between the wedding and the outbreak at the Sanford church."

Trump Sees U.S. Fully Vaccinated by April (3:13 p.m. NY)
President Donald Trump said his administration expects to be able to vaccinate every American against the novel coronavirus by April.
“We’ll have manufactured at least 100 million vaccine doses” by the end of the year, Trump said at a news conference on Friday. “We expect to have enough vaccines for every American by April.”
Trump’s timetable is more ambitious than those of drug industry executives and health officials including Anthony Fauci and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield, who have said most Americans shouldn’t expect a shot before mid-2021.
French Finance Chief Says He Tested Positive (3:13 p.m. NY)
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday, he said on Twitter.
Le Maire said he has no symptoms, and will continue to exercise his ministerial duties while quarantining for seven days.
CDC Backtracks on Virus Testing (2:25 p.m. NY)
Anyone who has spent 15 minutes or more within six feet of a person infected with Covid-19 should be tested, the CDC said in new guidelines. And even if the test is negative, an exposed person should still self-quarantine for 14 days.
Those who are in an area of high virus transmission and go to a large gathering with spotty public-health precautions may be advised to get a test by their doctor or a public-health official.
People who don’t have symptoms and aren’t in close contact of an infected person still don’t require a screening, unless it’s recommended by a medical provider or public-health official.
U.K.’s Johnson Warns of Further Curbs (2 p.m. NY)
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he is considering whether to “go further” with national restrictions after a surge in coronavirus infections in the U.K. raised the specter of another economy-sapping lockdown. London Mayor Sadiq Khan warned restrictions could be imposed if infections aren’t slowed.
With official daily cases running at levels last seen in May, the U.K.’s test-and-trace system is under strain and millions of people across the country have been placed under local restrictions to limit the spread of the disease.
California Deaths Edge Up (2 p.m. NY)
California reported 3,630 new virus cases, above the 14-day average of 3,396, according to the health department’s website. There have been a total of 769,831 cases in the state. The number of deaths increased by 91, below the 14-day average of 91, to 14,812.
France Cases Jump to Highest Since May (1:35 p.m. NY)
France’s daily coronavirus cases topped 13,000, the highest since the end of lockdown in May. Health officials blame the increase on social gatherings, especially among younger people, and on travelers bringing the virus back from vacation.
Arizona’s 7-Day Rate Jumps (1:23 p.m. NY)
Arizona on Friday reported 1,281 new virus cases, below Thursday’s spike of 1,753, but the 0.6% increase was still double the rate of the prior seven-day period. The state now has 212,942 cases. The state Department of Health Services recorded 42 new Covid-19 deaths, bringing the toll to 5,451.
Dublin Bans Indoor Dining (1:20 p.m. NY)
The Irish government on Friday slapped extra curbs on Dublin, as cases in the city spiked. Indoor dining in bars and restaurants will be banned, travel in and out the region will be restricted and Dubliners have been told to avoid international travel. Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin said without these restrictions, Dublin risked returning to the worst of the pandemic. The restrictions will be reviewed in three weeks.

Russia has approved its first drug to treat Covid-19 for sale in pharmacies, its maker R-Pharm said in a statement.
Coronavir underwent successful Phase 3 trials on 168 patients with Covid-19 and can treat people with mild to moderate cases, the company said. It could arrive in pharmacies as soon as next week.
Coronavir and Avifavir, another Russian drug that has been in use in hospitals since June, are based on favipiravir, an antiviral medicine that has had inconclusive results fighting Covid-19 in international studies.
Russia was the first country in the world to approve a Covid-19 vaccine for widespread use, registering it in August before Phase 3 trials had established its safety or effectiveness. Inoculations of medical workers could begin in October even as studies continue.
Greece Restricts Offices, Social Events in Athens Area (11:30 a.m. NY)
Greece tightened anti-pandemic measures for the second time in four days in the greater Athens area, where cases doubled in the past two weeks.
“It’s clear that there is an issue with the coronavirus in Attica that needs to be addressed,” Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said Friday.
Public and private gatherings in the region were limited to nine people, concerts were suspended and indoor cinemas closed. Weddings and similar events will be limited to 20 people from Monday until Oct. 4. Businesses must have 40% of employees work from home during the period.
Italy’s Cases Rise the Most Since May 1 (10:50 a.m. NY)
Italy reported 1,907 new cases on Friday, the highest daily increase since May 1, compared with 1,585 the previous day. New deaths declined to 10 from 13 on the day.
The number of Covid-19 patients in intensive care at hospitals declined by four to 208. That compares with a peak of more than 4,000 ICU patients in early April.
Florida’s Positive-Test Streak at Lowest Since June (11:15 a.m. NY)
Florida reported 677,660 Covid-19 cases on Friday, up 0.5% from a day earlier, compared to an average 0.4% increase in the previous seven days. That’s a daily change of 3,204 cases, according to the health department report, which includes data through Thursday.
The new daily rate of people testing positive for the first time fell to 4.2% for Thursday, from 4.4% on Wednesday. The rate has been under 5% for seven consecutive days, a streak last matched in the period ending June 8.
Deaths among Florida residents reached 13,225, an increase of 1.1%, or 139.
Vienna Curtails Its Waltz-Celebrating Ball Season (10:50 a.m. NY)
Some of the best-known events of the Viennese ball season were canceled on Friday amid Austria’s surge in infections. There’s no decision yet about the world-famous Vienna Opera.
Physical distancing rules “are the opposite of a ball’s basic idea,” a spokeswoman for the Committee of the Viennese Traditional and Noble Balls was quoted as telling the APA newswire.
Portuguese Leader Pleads With Public (10:40 a.m. NY)
Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa pleaded for people to use face coverings and follow distancing rules as new cases increase. “It’s not inevitable,” he said Friday. “We can stop this growth.”
The country is reporting the biggest rises in daily cases since April. There were 780 new cases in the latest 24 hour period, 10 more than on Thursday, taking the total to 67,176. Covid-19 patients in hospitals and intensive care fell.
Costa has said he wants avoid the “enormous cost” of lockdown measures adopted in March and April.
French Sports Teams Become Hotbeds (9:17 a.m. NY)
France’s soccer and rugby clubs have become hot spots for spread of the coronavirus after training and competition resumed following a summer break.
Since the end of July, health authorities have reported 88 Covid-19 clusters linked to sports clubs, most of them in the first two weeks of September, France’s public health agency said late Thursday.
U.K. Spread Accelerating With Lockdown Not Ruled Out (9:07 a.m. NY)
Boris Johnson’s government extended coronavirus restrictions across northern England and the Midlands, as ministers refused to rule out a short national lockdown to tackle a surge in infections.
Residents in parts of northwest England, the Midlands and West Yorkshire face measures including a ban on socializing with other people outside their own households, the Department of Health said on Friday.
For the U.K., the so-called R rate, or how many people each new Covid-19 case infects, is as high as 1.4, the government said, indicating the spread is accelerating.
De Blasio Vows to Avoid ‘Easy Way’ of Remote Classes (9:04 a.m. NY)
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said he has confidence in his latest timeline for in-class learning and won’t “take the easy way” by instituting all-remote learning for the nation’s largest school district.
“Remote education is easier, it’s less helpful for our kids and our families, it sets them back and we’re not going to let that happen,” de Blasio said Friday in an interview on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” program.
On Thursday, four days before all New York City schools were to reopen for in-person instruction, the mayor delayed classes for elementary schoolers until Sept. 29 and for middle- and high-school students until Oct. 1. The move, which followed an earlier delay that pushed the reopening to Sept. 21 from Sept. 10, frustrated parents and raised questions over whether the city would follow districts like Chicago and Los Angeles to start the year online.
Denmark Broadens Restrictions (8:35 a.m. NY)
Denmark is introducing a nationwide limit of 50 people on public gatherings and early closing times for bars and restaurants amid a record rise in Covid-19 cases.
From Saturday and until Oct. 4, businesses will be encouraged to let their employees work from home wherever possible. Citizens will be asked to limit their social circles, wear face masks in bars and restaurants and avoid public transport during rush hour, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said at a press conference in Copenhagen.
Prague Closes Universities, Schools Still Open (7:17 a.m. NY)
The city of Prague ordered its universities to close for in-person learning after the Czech Republic reported a record jump in new coronavirus cases.
Starting next week, higher-education classes will move online in the city of 1.3 million people, Prague Mayor Zdenek Hrib said on Twitter Friday. He said he had also wanted to close high-schools, but public-health officials rejected his proposal.
EU Seals Vaccine-Supply Deal With Sanofi/GSK (7:07 a.m. NY)
The European Commission announced a contract with drugmakers Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline on the purchase of as many as 300 million doses of any successful Covid-19 vaccine.
The commission, the European Union’s executive arm in Brussels, said in late July it had concluded exploratory talks with Sanofi/GSK for the supply of that number of doses for EU countries. The deal is the second EU advance purchase agreement following one with AstraZeneca.
U.S. Approaches 200,000 Virus Deaths (7 a.m. NY)
The U.S. will top 200,000 deaths from the novel coronavirus in coming days, a devastating milestone that comes eight months after the pathogen was first confirmed on American soil. The U.S., with 4% of the world’s population, accounts for about 21% of global coronavirus deaths.
With a population of 330 million, the U.S. reached 100,000 Covid-19 deaths on May 27, four months after the first recorded case. It has taken another four months to reach 197,633 as of Thursday evening, according to Johns Hopkins University. That’s a number roughly equal to the population of Yonkers, New York, or Huntsville, Alabama. Brazil ranks second in deaths, with almost 135,000 in a nation of 210 million.
London Faces Restrictions (5:49 p.m. HK)
London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he will be announcing restrictions over the “next few days and weeks.” While keen to avoid a version of lockdown used in other parts of the country, such steps were still a possibility, he said, according to LBC.
Earlier on Friday, the Evening Standard reported a surge of Covid-19 cases in London. The capital has recorded about 25 cases per 100,000 over the last seven days, rising from 18.8, according to the report, which didn’t say how it obtained the information.
Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also warned of “hard and difficult decisions in the coming days.”

Thousands of cases have been reported nationwide, forcing universities to switch to virtual classes and either quarantine or, in some cases, send students back home whether or not they're sick.
The situation has become serious enough that Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, is urging colleges: If at all possible, do not send students home.
Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak
""It's the worst thing you could do,"" he said Wednesday on NBC's ""TODAY"" show. ""When you send them home, particularly when you're dealing with a university where people come from multiple different locations, you could be seeding the different places with infection,"" said Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
Dr. Anthony Fauci predicts ‘safe and effective vaccine’ by end of 2020
Sept. 2, 202002:05
On Monday, Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, cautioned governors on a call that college students could become a source of outbreaks beyond campuses.
""Sending these individuals back home in their asymptomatic state to spread the virus in their hometown or among their vulnerable households could really re-create what we experienced over the June time frame in the South,"" Birx said, according to a source on the call.
Nationally, two of the biggest outbreaks have occurred in Iowa, in the counties home to the largest universities in the state: Iowa State University and the University of Iowa.
Iowa State reported a spike in cases the second week of school, with a 28.8 percent positivity rate among students tested for COVID-19. And according to the University of Iowa's COVID-19 dashboard, nearly 1,000 students have tested positive within the past two weeks.
Both colleges are still holding some in-person classes, usually as long as they do not exceed 50 students.
Wednesday, a group of students and faculty members at the University of Iowa planned a ""sickout"" in a show of solidarity over concerns about ""the rampant spread of COVID-19"" on campus.
""As students and educators, we have seen firsthand that there is no safe way to hold classes in person during this pandemic,"" the group wrote online.
At James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia,more than 400 cases of the coronavirus were reported less than a week after school started. University President Jonathan Alger announced plans to shift temporarily to online courses primarily and asked most students to leave campus by next Monday.The University of Notre Dame in Indiana has nearly 600 cases. Classes there switched to online only for two weeks, and the university is resuming in-person learning. Many students at North Carolina State University in Raleigh must move off campus this week.
Clusters were not unexpected. Put people in their late teens and early 20s into close quarters in dormitories and contagious illnesses are bound to spread, experts said.
""The college housing experience was not built for plagues,"" said Art Caplan, a professor of bioethics at NYU Langone Health. ""They're going to wander. They're going to visit each other. They're going to go into town. They're going to sneak off and have a party. This is what they do.""
What universities do next is critical, according to experts — their decisions could stop the spread of COVID-19, or keep it going.
""Some colleges have the capability of a dorm or a couple of floors of a dorm where they could keep people who are infected,"" Fauci said. ""Keep them at the university in a place that's sequestered enough from the other students so that you don't get a cluster in the university, but don't have them go home, because they could be spreading it in their home state.""

Many colleges have come up with plans to isolate sick students, with designated areas on campus for infected students who are not sick enough to be hospitalized.
The University of Wisconsin-Madison has set aside such housing for sick students to keep them in Madison. ""The concern about sending all these college kids back home is that we potentially increase transmission in many communities,"" said Dr. Jeff Pothof, an emergency medicine physician who is the university's chief quality officer.
Indeed, sending all students off campus — not just those confirmed to be infected — carries the risk of sending asymptomatic students home, where they could expose vulnerable family members.
""You potentially have a ton of people who don't even know they have disease,"" said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and an infectious disease physician at the Massachusetts General Hospital. ""Five days later, they're going to come down with symptoms — or maybe even not — and now they're living with their parents.""
It's been established that older adults and people with underlying health problems are at greater risk for more severe forms of the coronavirus, compared to children and younger adults.
Caplan suggests a different approach, at least when it comes to infected students.
""I think sending them home is better,"" he said, explaining that students' movements may be easier to control at home and that they may have better access to medical care depending on where they live.
What's more, keeping students on campus increases risks to instructors, cafeteria workers and other support staff members, even people who deliver food to the dorms.
Caplan acknowledges that it is a complex situation, without a single answer for all universities.
North Carolina State freshman Kathryn Livoti is preparing to move home Saturday, even though she has been doing everything possible to reduce her risk for COVID-19.
""We just do homework all the time. It's pretty much all we do,"" said Livoti, 18. ""I don't want to blame people who want to go out, because I want to, too. I just wish everybody had the mindset that if we want to stay on campus, we have to be careful.""

The university is now disclosing its isolation and quarantine capacity, as percentages, though it is still withholding the actual number of isolation and quarantine beds and how many are occupied.
Ball State is also not reporting positivity rates, which an epidemiologist says ""gives us a little better indication of which direction we're going — up or down or leveling off.""
As of 4:53 p.m. Wednesday, the university estimated it had 71 active cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), down from 158 as of 3:28 p.m. on Monday. Sixty-seven of the active cases were students and four were employees.
BSU President Goeffrey S. Mearns wrote on Monday that relatively few faculty and staff have tested positive since students returned to campus, and that there were many more people on campus who recovered than who tested positive for the coronavirus last week.
He also wrote that BSU continues to maintain ample testing capacity; that the student health center staff is ""presently able to assist people who have mild symptoms;"" and that the school recently deployed extra employees to conduct contact tracing, resulting in the ability to ""very promptly notify 'close contacts' so that they can immediately quarantine.""
The latest version of the dashboard reported present isolation capacity of 97.2% and quarantine capacity of 95.9%.
""We presently have more than ample available capacity for isolation and quarantine,"" Mearns wrote, noting that in addition to hundreds of spaces in university-owned facilities, the school has secured hundreds of rooms in local hotels for extra quarantine space.
Indiana State University this week reported one infected student isolating on campus, 21 infected students isolating off campus, 16 students quarantining on campus and 90 quarantining off campus.
But isolation/quarantine is the only metric included on ISU's dashboard, which lacks, for example, positivity rates, which means the percentage of people who test positive for the virus of those overall who have been tested.
Isolation separates infected people, while quarantine separates and restricts people who were exposed to the disease to see if they become sick.
Indiana University's latest weekly COVID-19 briefing includes an update on utilization of quarantine and isolation housing, as a percentage. The most recent utilization rate of quarantine and isolation facilities available for students living in residential housing was 34% on the Bloomington campus.
The Purdue University dashboard on Friday reported only 52 of its 884 isolation and quarantine beds were occupied.
""I want to know what those numbers are,"" says Thomas J. Duszynski, the parent of an ISU student and the director of epidemiology education at IUPU, referring to quarantine and isolation statistics. ""As a parent, I'd like to know so I can understand whether the university has a handle on the outbreaks of these infections.
""Are they able to identify these students quickly; are they getting them in isolation; are they quarantining those who were exposed to these individuals? Without that, obviously, the numbers are going to grow. Now, obviously, it's a population that's least likely to die from this disease or have severe disease, but it doesn't mean it can't happen.
""If the numbers are always going up, are they missing something in that investigation, in contact tracing, or are students not doing the things they're supposed to be doing? If the numbers are going down or are level, you know they've got a handle on the situation.""
Ball State initially reported a running total of the number of COVID-19 tests and running total of the number of positive cases on its dashboard. As the fall semester progressed, it then added the number of people tested and positive cases in the past 24 hours, then added a weekly summary of the number of cases and an estimate of how many of those cases recovered.

►COVID-19 claims four lives at local assisted-living facility
►Could COVID-19 cancel trick-or-treating?
""The recovery numbers are important because we focus so much on the number of cases and we focus a lot on mortality,"" Duszynski said in an online interview. ""That's a horrible number and it's bigger than what I think it needs to be in the United States.""
""Mortality is a number we like to report because it demonstrates the severity of this illness. The recovery aspect helps us understand that the majority of the people who get this are going to recover, unless they have comorbid health conditions or immunocompromised conditions.
""Recovery is the bookend of the whole story. You have a lot of people getting sick and, unfortunately, a group dying from this disease, but we also have the other end, the people who are recovering. In most cases, everybody who has recovered has antibodies, but the challenge now is, does this prevent you from future infection? … You can get a different strain even after recovering from another strain.""
While the frequency of cases — one of the metrics Ball State is reporting — is great to know, frequency is influenced by the number of people tested, Duszynski noted. ""If we go looking for it, we're going to find more of it.
""So the numbers are great but it's the trends that make more sense to people. The positivity rate is something the average person can look at and see which way the disease is trending, up or down or leveling off or somewhere in the middle. We can see which direction the disease is going.""

According to the New York Times, 9 of the 10 worst outbreaks in the US are in college towns.
Auburn University in Alabama is currently experiencing the country’s second-worst outbreak.
According to the updated data from The New York Times, the number of daily new COVID-19 cases in the US has stalled out over the last week or so. After peaking in July at around 66,000 cases per day, the infection rate began to decline near the end of the month and throughout much of August, but on August 23rd, the rate plateaued, and it just so happens that K-12 schools, colleges, and universities all began to reopen around that time.
We’ve seen outbreaks all over the country, from New York to Iowa to Alabama to California, and you probably won’t be surprised to learn that the parts of the country that are seeing the most significant surges in new cases are mostly college towns. In fact, as Best Life points out, 9 of the 10 cities that are experiencing the worst outbreaks in America have colleges or universities that have reopened and welcomed students back to campus.
The New York Times has been keeping track of the metro areas with the greatest number of positive cases relative to their population for quite some time, but the updated list shows just how disastrous school reopenings have been. Of the top 10 metro areas, these 9 are all home to colleges or universities that have reopened:
Auburn-Opelika, Alabama
Auburn University is one of two major public universities in the state of Alabama, and according to the latest data, it is experiencing the second-worst outbreak in the United States with 7.7 per 1,000 people testing positive in the metro area surrounding the school.
Statesboro, Georgia
Georgia Southern University makes up a significant portion of the population of Statesboro, and over the last two weeks, 710 have tested positive for COVID-19, which puts the area’s rate just under Auburn’s at 7.4 per 1,000.
Ames, Iowa
Iowa actually appears on the list twice, with Ames — the home of Iowa State University — outpacing its neighbor to the east by a hair with 1,143 cases in the last two weeks, tying Statesboro, Georgia with a novel coronavirus infection rate of 7.4 per 1,000.
Iowa City, Iowa
Iowa City, the home of the University of Iowa, had significantly more cases over the past two weeks (1,919) than Ames, but with a much larger population, its rate is slightly lower at 7.2 per 1,000 people.
Pullman, Washington
Washington state was the epicenter of the pandemic before cases started popping up around the country, but that didn’t stop Washington State University from reopening, and now Pullman has seen 485 new cases over the last two weeks, which is a rate of 6.3 per 1,000.
Oxford, Mississippi
Mississippi has been making headlines for months as the state has been designing a new flag to replace the one that incorporated the Confederate battle flag. They will vote on a new flag in November. That’s encouraging news, but the bad news is that Oxford, Mississippi, which is where the University of Mississippi is located, has reported 422 COVID-19 cases in the last two weeks, good for a rate of 5.2 per 1,000.
Bloomington, Illinois
Bloomington, Illinois has been climbing up the list in recent days, reaching the eighth spot 1,197 cases over the last two weeks for a rate of 4.4 per 1,000 as Illinois State University pledges to stay open.
Pine Bluff, Arkansas
Somehow, the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, with a student population of less than 2,600, has helped rocket the city of Pine Bluff, Arkansas into the top ten worst outbreaks in America, with 621 positive tests over the last two weeks, which brings the infection rate to 4.3 per 1,000.
Greenville, North Carolina
The 28,000+ Pirates of East Carolina University have dragged Greenville, North Carolina into the top ten, with 1,317 new infections over the last two weeks, which is an infection rate of 4.1 per 1,000.
Although we only covered the top ten metro areas, the New York Times list shows the twenty worst outbreaks in the US, and several more are in other big college towns, including Stillwater, Oklahoma, and Grand Forks, North Dakota. Whether or not we needed any more evidence that it was virtually impossible to reopen schools without causing new outbreaks, we now have it, and the trend will likely continue in the weeks ahead.

119,https://www.campussafetymagazine.com/university/cuomo-outbreak-guidance-colleges-in-person-classes/,-0.621,Cuomo Issues Outbreak Guidance for Colleges Holding In-Person Classes,"New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has released COVID-19 outbreak guidance for universities and colleges holding in-person classes.
On Thursday, Cuomo announced there will be a mandatory transition back to full-time remote learning for any school that hits 100 or more COVID-19 cases or 5% of the campus population, reports Pix 11. Athletics and extracurriculars would also be suspended and dining halls would only offer take-out.
“We should anticipate clusters,” Cuomo said. “When you have large congregations of people, anticipate a cluster. We know that, we expect it, we want to be prepared for it and that’s a threshold that we’re going to put in place.”
If the outbreak has not been contained after two weeks, the local health department could require further remote learning or impose “other mitigation measures” in consultation with the State Department of Health.
Notably, even if there is an outbreak at a college or university that doesn’t reach the threshold, the local department of health or the State Department of Health could still order the school to suspend activities on campus “upon a finding of the college’s inability to control the outbreak.”
The day before the governor released his guidance, administrators at New York University (NYU) released a COVID-19 update, stating that “between August 1 and August 23, more than 3,000 NYU faculty members, employees and researchers were tested for COVID-19, all of them negative; 7,772 students were tested, too—five of them positive.”
“While these data suggest a low prevalence of COVID-19, newly identified cases among members of the NYU community highlight the importance of NYU’s layered approach to safety and health, which will include robust, mandatory ongoing COVID-19 testing,” the report continues.
While NYU has so far avoided a large outbreak, that isn’t the case for other New York schools that started the semester with some level of in-person learning. SUNY Chancellor Jim Malatras announced a two-week suspension of in-person instruction at the SUNY Oneonta campus after 105 students tested positive.
The outbreak occurred after officials received reports of several large student parties, according to Buffalo News. Five students connected with hosting the parties, as well as three campus organizations, were suspended.
As a result, on Aug. 30, Cuomo deployed a SWAT team of 71 contact tracers and eight case investigators to help contain the outbreak.

A consensus is building among public health experts that it’s better to keep university students on campus after a Covid-19 outbreak rather than send them home as many are doing.
It’s easier to isolate sick or exposed students and trace their contacts if they stay put, said Ravina Kullar, epidemiologist and spokesperson for Infectious Diseases Society of America. Sending students home risks exposing other people there as well as along the way, and makes contact tracing all but impossible.
“There’s just inevitably going to be an outbreak,” she said. “Colleges need to take on the burden of having these students kept at their campus and taking care of them.”
The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill was one of the first to reverse in-person learning, sending students home to complete the semester remotely after the school had an outbreak. Colleges including Towson University and East Carolina University have done the same.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced Aug. 27 that schools in the state would switch to online learning for two weeks if they record 100 cases or 5% of the population gets infected, keeping students in place while tamping the virus’s spread. The University of Notre Dame adopted the same strategy, and announced Friday that it will resume in-person classes on Sept. 2.

U.S. President Donald Trump spoke of the risk this month while urging campuses to reopen, saying that sending students home after an outbreak could put relatives at risk. “Instead of saving lives, a decision to close universities could cost lives,” he said.
Notre Dame President John Jenkins had initially leaned toward clearing the campus when cases shot up to 147 less than two weeks after the first person was diagnosed. The county’s deputy health officer, Mark Fox, persuaded him to make classes remote and clamp down on interactions first to see if that could slow the spread.
Notre Dame had a solid plan for reopening its campus, Fox said. The challenge was the magnitude and the velocity of cases, he said. When it hit, the school ramped up testing, added more isolation beds and expanded contact tracing. Together with tight restrictions on interactions between those living on and off campus, Notre Dame slowed cases from jumping to communities surrounding the school.

For schools that send students home, contact tracing to help ensure they and their communities stay safe gets harder, especially for out-of-state students.
If students live relatively nearby or are in-state, tracers can do their job, said Howard Koh, former assistant secretary for health for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health professor. If students leave the state to go home, it’s less effective.
“That will make the job very difficult, if not impossible,” he said.
Contact tracing can help manage outbreaks when done correctly. The U.S. has struggled with it for many reasons, including getting people to answer the phone and respond truthfully. That’s even harder at college, when students worry about being disciplined for violating rules: Many schools have limited parties and other gatherings to reduce Covid-19 risks. Young people also relish finally being back with their friends.
“The more contacts a person has, the harder contact tracing can be,” said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. “People may not even know who they’re in contact with, especially if they are drinking.”
Effective programs interview a patient as soon as possible after a diagnosis to find out where they went while contagious, then contact anyone they encountered about their possible exposure. It’s usually recommended those contacts quarantine and monitor for symptoms.
In Chapel Hill, sick Tar Heels were isolated, and UNC quarantined anyone who was exposed when it announced it was sending students home on Aug. 17.
Those who went home were advised to self-isolate for 14 days, according to Ken Pittman, campus health executive director. Contact tracers have been effective in mitigating further spread, he said. Still, the UNC Covid dashboard showed another 26 new cases on Aug. 28.
Out of State
East Carolina reported 370 total positive cases from students as of Aug. 24. ECU’s contact tracing coordinator, Kelli Russell, said although they’ve run into issues with voice mailboxes that are full or not set up, students are answering their phones and speaking with the trained contact tracers, and have been transparent about where they have been and whom they have been in contact with.
UNC’s staff and student health services work with county officials to locate cases on campus or nearby and traces close contacts of students testing positive even if they’ve left campus, Pittman said. They’ll coordinate with local health departments when a close contact who isn’t a student is identified, even out of state.

121,https://www.browndailyherald.com/2020/09/17/comparing-browns-covid-19-positivity-rate-college-campuses/,-0.294,Comparing Brown’s COVID-19 positivity rate to other college campuses,"Out of over 23,000 asymptomatic COVID-19 tests administered at the University since the beginning of its academic-year testing program Aug. 24, under 0.1 percent have come back positive. 14 total cases have arisen out of over 6,000 people enrolled in the testing program, yielding a prevalence rate of 0.2 percent.
This testing rate has been accompanied by strict public health guidelines and the twice-weekly testing of students and staff.
While this rate has been lower than that of some other academic institutions across the country, the University must stay vigilant, said Dean of the School of Public Health Ashish Jha, a public health expert and advisor on the COVID-19 pandemic. The current low positivity rates are “really important because you want to start at a low baseline,” said Jha. But he doesn’t “expect us to stay that low.”
“Right now things are looking great, but we’re in the early days,” Jha said. “We haven’t really started (in-person) classes, so we haven’t had enough people back yet” to have the numbers reflect the impending in-person dynamic.
Providing context for positivity rates
The positivity rate — or, the number of positive tests out of total COVID-19 tests — provides not only information on how many cases there are, but also a metric for the extensiveness of testing, Jha said. “What you’re essentially saying is how much testing do you have to do, how hard do you have to look to find one case.”
If, for example, “you have to do … 1000 tests to find one (positive) case — that means you’re looking really hard, and there probably aren’t a lot of cases out there that you’re missing,” as is currently the situation at the University, he said.
While the positivity rate is a useful public health measure, it is one of a number of statistics experts look at to understand the spread of disease. Jha considers the positivity rate in the context of the total number of cases and trends: “I don’t look at the positivity rate in a vacuum,” he said.
The University’s COVID-19 dashboard
The University’s COVID-19 dashboard, released Sept. 8, has information about the weekly and overall positivity rate associated with the routine asymptomatic tests being completed at its two testing sites.
Some students have been paying attention to these numbers. “Personally, I’m quite obsessed with data, so I’ve been checking (the dashboard) every morning when I wake up,” said Advay Mansingka ’23, who arrived on campus during phase one of students’ staggered return to Brown. “It’s really nice to have an added level of information on what’s going on on campus,” he added.
The dashboard also includes the seven-day average positivity rates for the Providence and Rhode Island communities. While Jha believes it is beneficial to be aware of the situation within the broader community in case “those numbers start going up,” he said these data are not adequately comparable to those from the University because the city and state employ a different testing strategy.
The positivity rates of Rhode Island and Providence include symptomatic data, as reflected in the Rhode Island COVID-19 Response Data website. As of now, symptomatic tests administered to Brown community members are not reflected in the University’s dashboard.
“We need to find out about symptomatic cases, too,” Jha said. The University is testing symptomatic students through University Health Services, but may establish an alternative testing site in the future. “We’re going to have to come up with mechanisms to make sure that (data) shows up somewhere in the dashboard.”
Testing protocols and positivity rates across other campuses
The University’s COVID-19 dashboard is one among many that have been in use at colleges to publicly report testing results to the community and inform decisions.
As students returned to campuses across the nation, many peer institutions have received media coverage in prior months for their COVID-19 testing strategies — some have been deemed effective, others less so.
At the University of Notre Dame, students were shipped two COVID-19 testing kits in July; only if both tests came back negative were students permitted to return to campus in August, according to Notre Dame News. The university ultimately welcomed back a student body of about 12,000, according to The Chicago Tribune. But one week after in-person classes began, positivity rates climbed, and Notre Dame announced the shift to remote classes for two weeks with a phased return to in-person courses scheduled for later in the fall.
Following the campus outbreak, Notre Dame launched a surveillance testing program, where a random sample of students — and eventually staff and faculty — would be tested to “help avert potential outbreaks before they occur,” according to the university site. Since then, Notre Dame has “conducted 2300+ surveillance tests, with a positivity rate of 0.9 percent,” according to a university update, well below its highest rate of 20.6 percent, which was recorded in mid-August. Over the last 7 days, Notre Dame has had a positivity rate of about 1.4 percent according to its dashboard.
At the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which has more than 30,000 students, in-person courses resumed in early August. Courses transitioned to fully remote one week later, according to an announcement made Aug. 19. The announcement followed an increase in positivity rates “from 2.8% to 13.6%” over the course of one week, which were reported on UNC’s dashboard.
Prior to the outbreak, UNC was “essentially only testing students who were symptomatic,” Jha said, adding that many of the students would have “already spread the virus by the time they felt symptoms.” Symptomatic testing “basically tells you after the fact that a big outbreak has already happened.”
Following the spike in COVID-19 cases, UNC offered COVID-19 testing for students residing in the on-campus residence halls linked to the outbreak, according to an announcement made Aug. 20.
Jha said that Brown may consider testing all students living in a specific residence if a similar situation were to occur on campus, The Herald previously reported.
In late August, UNC’s program started offering voluntary testing to asymptomatic people on campus, as well as diagnostic testing for “close contacts and symptomatic students,” according to the UNC Campus Health site.
The week of Sept. 7 through 13, UNC conducted just 163 tests with a positivity rate of 4.3 percent.
While delaying the return to in-person classes, Brown announced that the University would be conducting asymptomatic testing on all enrolled students returning to Providence in early August. “We know that participation in a COVID–19 testing and tracing program combined with consistent mask wearing, social distancing and increased hand washing is essential for slowing the spread of this virus,” President Christina Paxson P’19 wrote in an Aug. 11 community-wide email.
Similarly, Harvard implemented a widespread, tiered asymptomatic testing program.
About 25 percent of the student body — including first-years and some students with unique circumstances — were allowed to return to campus this fall, though courses will be offered entirely online, according to Harvard Magazine. Students and faculty who are on campus have been adhering to “unobserved self-administered testing,” which is accompanied by an online module that guides them on how to complete their own COVID-19 nasal swab. Students and faculty have been asked to follow this process from one to three times a week, depending on factors such as whether they live on or off campus. Participants then drop off these testing kits at one of many bins found throughout the campus, according to the Harvard website.
Harvard’s dashboard currently reflects the test results of all students and faculty who are “authorized to be on campus” and who have completed the self-administered testing, according to the dashboard site. Over the last seven days, Harvard has conducted more than 12,000 tests with a positivity rate of about 0.09 percent.
Reflecting on the situation at other colleges
While public health organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have used five percent as a threshold for high positivity rates, Jha believes that number is too high to be used by others as a metric for action. “What I’ve seen is often people are just too slow — they use a threshold like five percent, and then they watch it creep up, and then by the time you hit (that) percent, they act, but it’s way too late.”
“I would act much earlier than that, and I think the University is going to act much earlier than that,” he added.
While Jha attributes some of the outbreaks that have occurred on other campuses like UNC to a lack of surveillance testing, there are others, like the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign that were proactive but had outbreaks influenced by irresponsible student behavior, he said. “There isn’t a surveillance program that will save you from students who go and host large … parties after they’re positive. That’s the kind of stuff we have to avoid on campus.”
“Ultimately this is going to be a partnership between University leadership … (and) with students and staff,” Jha said. “I firmly believe that Brown can be one of the true role models for how to do this well, but it’s going to take everybody working together.”"

As of Tuesday afternoon, there are 290 active confirmed cases of COVID-19 on the Ole Miss campus, according to university officials.
As the university enters the second week of classes, the number of COVID-19 cases is being tracked and posted on the University of Mississippi website.
Chancellor Glenn Boyce had a message Tuesday for Ole Miss students, faculty and staff in which he thanked the university community for its support. Boyce said he and a group of university leaders met Friday with the state’s top health officials for guidance on the isolation and quarantine process.
“Thanks to our robust contact tracing efforts through our team of expert volunteers from the School of Applied Sciences, we have discerned that spread of the virus on our campus is not prevalent in classrooms and academic spaces,” Boyce said in the statement. “We have linked a number of cases and outbreaks to a failure to follow the protocols in other settings, primarily off-campus social gatherings.”
Boyce urged students and staff to adhere to social distancing guidelines while on and off campus."

Social media posts are churning across the state as Ohio schools reopen amid the pandemic:
A football coach is hospitalized with COVID-19 and his team is quarantined.
A student with no symptoms infected his classmates.
A handful of teachers tested positive before in-person school even began.
Many Ohio schools have refused to either knockdown or substantiate the rumors, citing privacy concerns. And that’s caused frustration and fear among many parents and teachers already uneasy about sending children back to class.
Last Thursday, Gov. Mike DeWine seemed to offer a potential solution: He said the state will soon require that each Ohio school publicly report COVID-19 cases among students and staff within 48 hours of learning of a case.
But just how much information will be released and how helpful it will be for parents making tough choices about their family’s safety is not yet clear.
Neither the Ohio Department of Health nor the Ohio Department of Education answered questions submitted by a reporter last Thursday. Representatives for both departments referred the reporter to the order, which will not be available until this week.
What can schools release?
Balancing privacy against the public’s right to know can be complicated.
A federal law prohibits the disclosure of personal medical records by health providers, but the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) doesn’t extend to schools. Another federal law governs educational privacy; yet the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) allows the release of case information, as long as people, including students, are not named.
But some public officials say that it isn't names alone hat identify individuals.
The Warren County Health Department emphasized the issue of inadvertently publicly identifying schoolchildren or employees even without releasing their names: ""When there are small numbers of cases, a small number of total students (and) employees within a small population – schools – reporting specific numbers could disclose the identity of the cases which is against HIPAA law,"" a statement released by Health Commissioner Duane Stansbury says.
Giving out too many details can identify a child even if a district doesn’t release a name, said Jarrod Tudor, director of regional campuses and education at the University of Akron.
“We have a 9 year-old son ... one kid in a district,” Tudor said. “But if we say one boy in Mrs. Turner’s class, you’ve narrowed it down to nobody else but him if my son doesn’t show up for school.”
So Ohio school districts tend to be cautious to protect students’ identities, whether they’re reporting numbers of children infected with meningitis or the flu.
Often, they stick to numbers and make them as generic as possible, Tudor said. They typically report district-wide cases without ever identifying which schools were involved, let alone which classrooms, clubs or teams.
COVID-19 could be different
Earlier this year, as the pandemic spread, the U.S. Department of Education released additional guidance to schools about releasing information about COVID-19 infections.
Recognizing its risk and scale of spread, the agency noted that extraordinary circumstances might mean schools would need to share details that could identify a person with the coronavirus so others can “take appropriate precautions.”
Does that open the door for schools to provide more detailed reporting if an outbreak happens among a particular school marching band, kindergarten class or school bus route?
Maybe.
During a press briefing last Thursday, DeWine sketched out the general terms of an order all Ohio schools will follow during the pandemic. Among other things:
Every district must have a mechanism, possibly existing attendance reporting systems, for parents and guardians of students and school staff to report positive COVID-19 tests of students. DeWine said other COVID-19 information could be shared on the school hotline, too. He didn’t elaborate, but that could involve a student or staff member with symptoms, or someone who learned she was exposed to COVID-19.
Within 48 hours of receiving information on a positive test, the school district must report it to the local health department and make that information publicly available, possibly through a press release or a post to the school website or Facebook page. Districts must also provide parents and guardians with a copy of “as much information as possible without disclosing protected health information,” possibly through text or email.
Local health departments will collect the school data and share it with the state health department weekly. The state will compile the information and release it once a week.
DeWine left lots of wiggle room about what parents, school staff and the public will learn about COVID-19 outbreaks – and what they won’t.
“If the community has widespread (COVID-19), it will be reflected in the school,” he said. “It does not mean at all that the school has done anything wrong.”
At the same time, schools will be working closely with local health departments. In Hamilton County, for example, the health department has assigned a team member to each school so that the department will have a quick response when questions arise. Spokesman Mike Samet said the health department will follow the direction of the state on reporting COVID-19 cases in schools.
The local health departments are also set to be involved in contact tracing.
""If we have a positive case at a school, we would contact that individual and work with the school to get a list of contacts, and the case will be reported as positive case in our county’s totals,"" said Keith Robinson, Clermont County Health Department spokesman. But, he added, the county department does not plan to ""identify a school in which the student or staff member attends.”
Contact tracers across the state will notify those who they believe may have been put at risk by being exposed to someone infected with COVID-19.
But that’s likely far fewer people than might want to know if they’ve had a brush with someone who tested positive, said Scott DiMauro, president of Ohio Education Association, which represents more than 100,000 teachers and staff working in Ohio’s schools.
Contact tracing, he said, only works in schools if you can guarantee that everyone in a school maintained 6 feet of physical distancing, wore a mask and washed their hands as thoroughly and as often as they’re supposed to 100% of the time.
“Our position is there needs to be transparency,” DiMauro said. “Don't disclose a name, but if there is a case in a particular building in a particular classroom on a particular day, tell us.”
DiMauro said the majority of OEA’s members feel pretty good about the plans schools have laid to reopen.
But no one will know for another month to six weeks how successful schools are at preventing spread, so sharing information about COVID-19 outbreaks is important, he said.
“It’s common sense to assume every child and every adult in that confined space with limited air flow were all exposed,” he said. “If I’m a parent of one of those children, I absolutely want to know. If I’m a teacher in that room, then I absolutely have a right to know.”
Just a snapshot in time
Dr. Joseph Zarconi, a professor and chair of internal medicine at the Northeast Ohio Medical University in Rootstown, said it’s unlikely parents or teachers will get all of the information they may crave because of legally mandated privacy restrictions.
But that may not matter, he said.
“I think parents need to behave as though there is a kid infected in (their child’s) class all of the time,” Zarconi said. “I’m not sure how reporting changes that.”
Data, he cautioned, is always incomplete and only provides a snapshot in time.
“In every type of pandemic...we always say you should be more concerned with what you don’t know than what you do know,” Zarconi said.
If a third-grader tests positive, for instance, he’s no longer in school by the time the case is reported to the school and parents, teachers and the public are notified.
But what won’t be clear for days or weeks is how many other people may have been infected before that child was kept home from school and tested, Zarconi said.
He also worries that COVID-19 infection information released by schools could inadvertently drive infection rates higher if the numbers are initially low and people have a false sense of safety.
“As data start to come out, and numbers don’t look bad, does that cause some of the families who said I’m not going to send my kids back to change their minds and say, ‘Maybe it’s OK’?” Zarconi asked.
More children in schools mean a greater risk for infection, he said.
Initially, low infection rates in schools also could cause people to drop their guard and become lax about enforcing social distancing and other measures to prevent the spread, he said.
Regardless of information schools release about infections, Zarconi said he wouldn’t risk children playing any fall sports.
“The evidence is clear across the nation: Whenever we’ve gone to more strict physical distancing, masks, hand hygiene, the number of infections drop,” Zarconi said. “None of those things can be assured in athletics ... fall athletics should be shut down completely.”
Extra-curricular activities from chess club to marching band should be reassessed, too, he said.
If an activity, like the yearbook staff, can carry on remotely, he said, all activity should move online.
For others, like a chess club, safety might be more challenging, he said. While students could still mask and physically distance for chess matches, there is still built-in risk because players touch the same game pieces and then often touch their mask or faces.
Marching band, Zarconi said, is a good example of being cautious about what we don’t know during a pandemic.
COVID-19 often spreads through the air on invisible plumes of saliva when people exhale, cough or even sing. It’s not clear if someone infected with COVID-19 might potentially spread the disease by blowing into a flute, trombone or clarinet.
“But if you don’t know whether 30 kids with wind instruments are blowing viruses all over the field,” Zarconi said, “act as if they are.”

Amidst a national debate on how to safely reopen schools during the coronavirus pandemic, several colleges and universities took the plunge, inviting students back to dorms and classrooms with strict health guidelines.
More than a third of the nation’s 5,000 higher education campuses have reopened, with students from out of state ordered to quarantine, masks mandated and routine self-checks for symptoms instituted across the board. To comply with social distancing guidelines, parties or large gatherings are forbidden.
But, just a few weeks into the fall semester, the experiment is faltering. Colleges and universities across the country are struggling to contain surges of COVID-19 cases on campus. As of Tuesday, more than 25,000 students and campus staff in at least 37 states had tested positive for the virus—mostly concentrated in southern states that were already struggling to contain a COVID-19 crisis.
The numbers are expected to increase as more colleges prepare to open their doors after Labor Day.
“The University of South Carolina is a large university but, compared to other schools opening up after Labor Day, our cases will be a drop in the bucket,” Dr. Helmut Albrecht, chairman of the Department of Internal Medicine at the University of South Carolina in Columbia and Prisma Health, told The Daily Beast. “We’re worried but we’re managing. Other universities should be scared.”
On Thursday, the University of South Carolina recorded 1,026 positive coronavirus tests among their 35,000 student body, and in the past week they had a test positivity rate among students and faculty of 26.3 percent.
Administrators at the southern school are finally cracking down after becoming one of the hardest-hit campuses in the nation following a slew of large parties, including one crowded pool party over the weekend shut down by the fire department.
On Monday, the school announced that 15 students had been placed under interim suspension and six Greek organizations had been charged with student conduct violations after hosting parties.
In addition, the school placed three Greek Village houses in quarantine after residents tested positive, bringing the total number in quarantine to nine houses—or nearly half of the school’s fraternity and sorority chapter houses.
“Our total number of active cases is larger than we expected at this point, and some student behavior off-campus is both disappointing and unacceptable,” Bob Caslen, the university’s president, said in a Tuesday letter to the university. “We are confronting these realities and taking action.”
The disciplinary action came days after hundreds of mask-less students were seen at a pool party near campus that defied the city’s mask ordinance and social distancing mandates. As one of the earliest states to loosen coronavirus restrictions, South Carolina is still struggling to contain COVID-19, with a death toll of 2,652 and a current positivity rate of almost 20 percent.
Fire Chief Aubrey Jenkins told The State on Saturday that, as he was breaking up the massive pool party, one person told him, “I can’t catch COVID. I’m immune to the stuff.”
“It was almost like Mardi Gras,” Jenkins told the newspaper. “I saw a large crowd in the pool, in the area on the side of the pool, and on top of the pool house.” He said no fines were issued.
Despite the uptick in coronavirus cases at USC, Albrecht said administrators have been preparing for possible outbreaks for five months and knew that bringing students back “was an uphill battle.” He stressed that the influx of positive tests has “a lot of positive consequences” for the community because it helps curtail the spread into the general public. However, university officials say that about 90 percent of cases are among students and that the spread is not occurring in classrooms—but off-campus.
“We expected a lot of positives,” Albrecht said, adding that the best approach was to test widely rather than close down the school, which would only further harm the community. “We were hoping for slightly less and we were hoping we would not see pool parties and that kind of stuff, but, in all honesty, this is part of their lifestyle—this is why you go to college. We are not happy about it but we are managing.”
Thousands of miles away at Indiana University, 75 percent of the school’s Greek houses are now under quarantine—and officials on Thursday said they wanted all fraternity and sorority houses shut down on its Bloomington campus.
Citing “an increasingly alarming” rate of positive test results—including a staggering 50 percent positive testing rate in some houses—officials said they now “believe Greek houses are not safe given the pandemic conditions and the current spread of COVID-19.”
“Given the Greek housing structure, avoiding close contact with residents who may carry the virus is virtually impossible,” the university tweeted. “Dorms are not seeing the level of positivity rates that are being found in Greek houses.”
There are 2,600 students in 42 communal living houses at IU, a university spokesman told The Daily Beast, including 40 fraternity and sorority houses, in which 30 are currently under quarantine.
Ohio State officials are also struggling to contain the virus after cases jumped by nearly 400 since last week. To date, 882 students have tested positive, with an overall positive rate of 3.13 percent. That statistic, however, jumps to 5.7 percent among on-campus students and 10 percent for those living off-campus, according to data released on Monday.
The school has already suspended 228 students for violating coronavirus-related safety guidelines and has threatened to crack down on gatherings of more than 10 people.
There have also been large outbreaks at Iowa State and the University of Iowa—a state now recording the largest increase in COVID-19 cases in the nation.
“I am confident that by strictly following [university] guidelines we can drive this positivity rate down,” Kristina M. Johnson, the Ohio State University president, said in a Wednesday email to the school, admitting that off-campus rates are not “encouraging.” “We need your focused attention to move in that direction and keep each other, our families, and all Ohioans safe and healthy.”
But while some colleges have become overwhelmed by new cases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has urged universities not to send students home because it risks furthering the spread. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Notre Dame have followed this advice and reverted to online learning while still housing students on campus after more than 100 students tested positive.
SUNY Oneonta on Thursday said the school would close and switch to fully remote learning for the rest of the semester after 389 people tested positive for COVID-19. “Although this situation is unsettling, I must ask for patience and cooperation from students and families as we work to help students get home to resume remote learning as safely and quickly as possible,” President Barbara Jean Morris said in a letter sent to the campus community.
Temple University also suspended most of their in-person classes on Thursday after the Philadelphia school reported more than 200 COVID-19 cases just two weeks into the fall semester.
“It's the worst thing you could do,” Fauci said Wednesday on NBC’s Today show. “When you send them home, particularly when you're dealing with a university where people come from multiple different locations, you could be seeding the different places with infection.”"

Campus officials also reported that the virus has spread to some of the school’s dorms.
County health officials announced a short time later that they’re investigating whether the investigations constitute an outbreak.
The figures were released as a private security company was expanding its monitoring of students, many who have been ignoring rules that require them to wear masks and to practice social distancing.
The San Diego Union-Tribune observed at least 200 students shrugging off the rules late Friday and early Saturday, including many at Paseo Place, a student housing complex.
Similar problems are occurring at dozens of colleges nationwide, leading UC San Diego to consider requiring students to be tested for COVID-19. About 14,500 students will live in UCSD dorms this fall.
SDSU President Adela de la Torre could not be reached Monday for comment. She has declined several previous requests from the Union-Tribune to discuss the situation, including SDSU’s decision to let 2,600 students live in dorms.
The university said that three of the 13 newly-confirmed infections involve students who live in Zapotec, Villa Alvarado Apartments and South Campus Plaza North, which are part of SDSU’s dorm system. South Campus is near the university’s transit station. There also has been at least one infection at M@College Apartments, an off-campus dorm. SDSU didn’t specify a number.
A total of 41 SDSU students, faculty, staff and independent contractors have tested positive for COVID-19 since testing began in the spring. About half of those infections have been reported over the past two weeks.
The infection rate could be higher. People are also being tested at a county facility on-campus. The county has not reported specific findings for that site.
“We quickly identified and have spoken with the individuals known to have been in direct contact with the students,” SDSU said in a statement. “Again, all are following established public health protocols for isolation and quarantine, and exposure risk to others on campus is deemed low.”
Brenden Tuccinardi, editor-in-chief of SDSU’s Daily Aztec, says students have to shelter some of the blame for what’s been happening.
""(Last) weekend and the weekend before made it very clear university administrators placed too much faith in students’ ability to follow the rules,” Tuccinardi said late Monday.
“The recent measures taken to slow the spread at SDSU are a good first step, but at the end of the day, the burden does not fall solely on administration. Students need to call their friends out and police themselves or administration will be forced to step in.”"

Temple University released a statement on Sunday that it is suspending in-person classes after 103 student have tested positive for COVID-19.
On Friday, the university reported 58 active COVID-19 cases, but additional test results have been received, raising the count to 103.
An active case is not only a positive test result for COVID-19 that requires self-isolation but also means the individual has ""not yet met CDC criteria for system-based recovery"" according to the university's active cases on campus webpage.
In a statement on the university's website, it says most of the students are asymptomatic but ""a small number have mild to moderate flu-like symptoms.""
The statement goes on to say, ""Any increase is concerning, though not necessarily alarming. In this instance, we appear to be seeing new cases that result from small social gatherings happening off campus. This trend prompted conversations with the Philadelphia Department of Public Health (PDPH) and resulted in the revised guidance issued by PDPH on Saturday. The new data also prompted the university's leadership to implement the flexibility embedded in the comprehensive plans we developed earlier this year. After reviewing this new information, we are instituting a two-week 'pause' for in-person classes, and an extensive collaboration with PDPH to test and contact trace student cases and minimize further spread.""
Starting Monday, Aug. 31 through Friday, Sept. 11 all in-person classes will switch to online only. Only classes designated as essential by the dean of a school or college will be held in person during this time. Students in classes deemed essential will be notified directly by their school or college. Classes which are already online will not be impacted by this decision.
The university reminds students and faculty that anyone with symptoms should immediately contact Student Health Services and get an appointment to be tested.
On Monday, The Philadelphia Department of health will assist the university in offering additional testing from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. in the practice facility at the Aramark STAR Complex on Main Campus.
University staff and students are encouraged to utilize a special COVID-19 Helpline for questions or advice starting Monday at 8:30 a.m. that number is 215-204-4400.
These are some essential reminders and information provided by the university to help guide students and staff:
It is vital that all students continue to follow Temple's four public health pillars, particularly properly wearing a face covering. Students should wear a face covering on campus and anywhere in Philadelphia—that is especially true for living in the neighborhoods of North Philadelphia.
Do everything possible to avoid social gatherings, regardless of size, that brings yourself into contact with persons outside of your household. Introducing new people into your household, even in very small groups, is increasingly being identified as a cause of infections.
Strongly consider canceling travel plans, including those around Labor Day weekend.
All students who have been in contact with anyone who has tested positive for COVID-19 should immediately quarantine for 14 days.
Student support services will remain operational, such as Charles Library, the TECH Center and the Student Center. The university’s residence halls and food services will continue to operate.
Faculty with questions about this shift should contact their department chairs and deans for additional guidance.
Those employees who are currently working from home should continue to do so, subject to supervisor approval.
Those employees working on campus should continue to do so until notified otherwise by a supervisor."

The university consolidated student housing to clear room to quarantine students, banned student events and encouraged compliance with preventative measures.
But many students worry it was too little, too late. And some students say UA has not done enough to protect them from contracting the virus.
Several days a week, Carlee Fernandez works as a front desk assistant at Burke Hall, a red-brick residence hall that rises five floors above Paul W. Bryant Drive on the south end of UA’s campus.
It’s a pretty typical student desk job: check people in, help out when students lose their keys or lock themselves out of their dorm rooms, and perform other basic administrative tasks. But as of last week, the position put Fernandez, a 22-year-old UA senior from Helena, on the front lines of one of the nation’s most severe campus COVID-19 outbreaks.
On Monday, the university announced that all students living on one side of Burke Hall would have to move out to free up rooms to isolate and quarantine students who test positive for the virus or come in contact with someone who has.
Four days later, UA reported that the university added 481 new student COVID-19 cases from Tuesday to Thursday, a rapid escalation given that there were 562 new student cases over the previous six days. The university also reported Friday that over 36% of its isolation space in Tuscaloosa was occupied.
For Fernandez, concerns about the rising case count were compounded by her belief that there has been “a complete lack of transparency and communication from the university” about its plans for quarantining students and how it is protecting healthy students, employees and faculty. She said she first learned via Twitter that the school was converting half of the building where she works to isolation space.
“If there’s no communication, if we’re not being informed on how to deal with COVID patients as a desk assistant, we could all be at risk of contracting COVID,” Fernandez said in a phone interview Saturday. “A lot of us are really concerned and scared, not only for ourselves, but for the other housing staff and students.”
Lack of guidance
Burke Hall has two towers - Burke West and Burke East - connected by a wide shared space on the ground floor. Burke West was the one cleared out last week to make room for students under quarantine. The front desk Fernandez works behind is in the middle of the shared ground-floor space, where she and her co-workers greet and help residents of both towers.
Any job that requires workers to sit for hours in an indoor space and interact with members of the public carries a level of risk during a viral pandemic. But what concerns Fernandez is her belief that UA has done too little to limit her and her co-workers’ exposure to the virus. She said the university has provided gloves, hand sanitizer and masks for months, but did not offer additional training or materials to help keep employees who must now interact directly with sick and exposed students from contracting COVID-19 themselves.
Clear Plexiglas barriers between the ceiling and two higher tiers of the Burke Hall front desk provide some protection. But the lower, central tier of the desk - which is where most conversations and exchanges take place - had no such barrier in place as of Saturday evening.
Yet numerous students had already moved into the hall’s designated COVID-19 tower. Fernandez told AL.com she has personally seen students moving into Burke West.
“The students are coming in. A few of them came up to the front desk just with their masks on and their stuff in their hands and were like, ‘I’m here to move into isolation. What do I do?’” she said. “We were never told what to do if someone comes for isolation, we were just told that they might clear Burke West for isolation if needed.”
Monica Watts, a spokeswoman for UA, said in an emailed statement Friday that the school’s “top priority” is safety:
“As we prepared for the fall semester, we worked closely with student leaders, faculty members and our staff to develop plans to minimize the risk of COVID-19 and to respond as cases occurred … For students who are in isolation or quarantine, we are providing meals and comprehensive services to address all aspects of support and care.”
Instead of hands-on training, Fernandez said she and her co-workers were given a one-page list of frequently asked questions with short pre-written responses to consult if they are asked any of six specific questions about the school’s decision to relocate students to make room for additional isolation space.
“Why are we having to move?” reads one of the questions. “[Housing and Residential Communities] was trying to be proactive and create isolation spaces in case they are needed.”
Since then, Fernandez says she has spoken on the phone with Myron Pope, UA’s vice president for student life, about her concerns. She provided AL.com with a copy of notes he sent her listing specific suggestions she had made for improving safety at the Burke Hall front desk.
The ideas include installing more Plexiglas, adding signage to direct students to use side doors when possible, providing “training on how to deal with COVID positive students,” and communicating better with employees. As of Saturday, the changes had yet to be instituted, according to Fernandez.
‘I was devastated’
Morgan Quillin was only six days into her freshman year at UA when she received an email from the university stating that she had two days to move out of Burke West and into a room in Burke East. The 18-year-old nursing major, who was already reeling from the experience of moving from her hometown of Huntsville into her first dorm in the middle of a global pandemic, said she was shocked to learn she would have to move again so soon.
“We had no idea where we were going to be moving or if my roommate and I would be separated. A lot of things were up in the air. I had a panic attack while my roommate was frantically packing and trying to console me,” Quillin told AL.com. “I was devastated and so incredibly scared. I felt abandoned by the school I’ve looked up to my whole life.”
The next day, she and her roommate - who asked to remain anonymous - learned they had been assigned separate rooms, but that they would both be on the same floor in Burke East. They filed a work order and slept in their new rooms Tuesday night. On Wednesday morning, Quillin awoke to an email from a UA Housing representative who apologized for the mix-up and was ultimately able to get her reassigned to live with her original roommate.
Watts said Friday that “[s]ome students were recently relocated as we consolidated residence hall space - a standard practice each year as we attempt to make the most efficient use of space - and to make more room for potential COVID-19 isolation. Students who were moved did not incur additional costs and were provided assistance and incentives to make up for their inconvenience.”
While she appreciates the university’s efforts to right the situation, Quillin says she is still upset about the way she was treated.
“My biggest concern while moving was the fact that I didn’t know who I was going to be rooming with,” she said. “I don’t know if they had been social distancing or wearing a mask or anything.”
A big deal
Lila Bogle, a 19-year-old UA sophomore from Franklin, Tenn., was sitting in a cavernous lecture hall with dozens of other students for her statistics class last week when a student behind her sneezed. When Bogle turned around to say bless you, the student’s mask had been pulled down. Bogle asked her why her mask was not covering her nose and mouth in accordance with university policy.
“She was like, ‘I only pulled down my mask to sneeze, it’s not that big of a deal,’” Bogle recalled. “But it is that big of a deal! I couldn’t believe that she said that because what do you think you’re wearing a mask for?”
Bogle, who lives in an on-campus residence hall that the university has not converted to isolation space, said that kind of dismissive attitude toward basic preventative measures is common among some UA students. So she stays in her room as much as possible and wears a mask whenever she leaves, as she is worried about the proliferation of COVID-19 and what she sees as insufficient action by UA to slow its spread.
“I think a lot of people aren’t taking it very seriously,” she said. “There is some partying and going out still, just based on hearing girls arrive back at their rooms on weekends and sounding drunk when they get back. I think the step that [the city of Tuscaloosa] took shutting down the bars was a good step to try to crack down. But I think to really crack down on it they’d have to start having rules about people leaving their rooms and their dorms.”
Most of the other students and faculty who spoke with AL.com since Thursday also said they have been disappointed by the unwillingness of a significant portion of the student body to take common-sense steps to avoid spreading the coronavirus, like social distancing, avoiding crowded indoor areas and wearing masks.
“Most students seem to be following social distancing guidelines, but some aren’t. It’s those few that are ruining it for everyone,” Quillin said. “It’s been disappointing seeing my peers have such complete disregard for everyone else’s health and safety.”
What’s to be done
While the case count continues to grow and frustrations and fears fester on campus, students and faculty worry what will come of the rest of the semester at UA. Nearly all of the more than a dozen students and faculty who spoke with AL.com since Wednesday said they believe the university will likely cancel in-person classes soon, for better or worse.
“My roommate and I have not completely unpacked. We’re scared we’ll get sent home within the next week or two and will have to do this process all over again,” Quillin said.
“I feel that the university should just send everyone home. This just isn’t working. I expected campus to be lively and exciting, but it’s just been so disappointing,”
Bogle said that while she believes the university has taken some positive steps in recent days to limit the spread of coronavirus and avoid canceling in-person classes, she worries that they may not be enough.
“There’s only so much that they can actually do past what they’ve already done, short of getting rid of in-person classes,” she said.
“I think that if people aren’t on campus, then nobody is on campus to get [COVID-19.] So it’s a good move for the general student body. But I’m also conflicted about it because I struggled last semester with online classes because I can’t learn like that. So it’s kind of lose-lose for me.”
Watts, the UA spokeswoman, said the university has taken a proactive approach to limiting the spread of COVID-19 on campus.
“In the last week, we have implemented a moratorium on student events and taken additional steps to reduce the virus’ spread. The City of Tuscaloosa suspended on-premise consumption of alcohol at bars for 14 days, beginning last Monday,” Watts said. “We are confident these measures will do everything possible to help bend the curve.”
Fernandez said she believes it’s too late for UA to significantly slow the spread and that she does not believe there is anything the school could do to make her feel safe on campus.
“I have been concerned since the day I found out we were going back to campus. This is just insane. There are schools that have closed because they had 80 cases and we’ve had over 1,000 in a week and we’re still open,” she said.
“For me I just want to feel safe, and I want other people to feel safe, too. But I don’t think anything’s going to make me feel safe.”

130,https://slate.com/human-interest/2020/08/how-colleges-are-blaming-their-students.html,-0.971,How Colleges Are Blaming Their Students for Coronavirus Outbreaks,"Colleges across America have logged more than 26,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 since March, according to the New York Times, which is pulling together university-specific data in the absence of a more formal database. The Times notes that this number is likely on the low side—“with no national tracking system, colleges are making their own rules for how to tally cases”—and that most of these cases have been reported since late July.
With no national strategy to fight the coronavirus, colleges have been left to make their own rules on if and how to reopen and what steps to take once an outbreak occurs. And the outbreaks—they are certainly occurring. Which means colleges are also needing to figure something else out: where to place the blame. The answer is often, as experts predicted, on the students. Here’s why there have been outbreaks on college campuses, according to school administrators:
Students going to bars. The campus with the most coronavirus cases as of Monday according to the New York Times is the University of Alabama at Birmingham (972 cases). [Update, Sept. 2, 2020, at 12:42 p.m.: UAB disputes the way the Times is counting cases; during the whole pandemic, there have been 239 cases among faculty and staff by the school’s count.] “We remain satisfied that the precautions implemented prior to the resumption of classes—including masking, distancing, and a blend of in-person and remote instruction—are appropriate and effective,” Ricky Friend, the dean of the College of Community Health Sciences at UA, said in a statement published Friday concerning the three-school system of UAB, University of Alabama (in Tuscaloosa), and the University of Alabama in Huntsville. In-person classes are still in session, but school officials at UA specifically, which has logged 568 cases, did ask the mayor of Tuscaloosa to close bars, which he did for a two-week period, starting Aug. 24.
Students holding parties. After an outbreak of more than 100 positive cases at SUNY Oneonta in upstate New York, five students “have been suspended for holding parties against the college policy,” said SUNY Chancellor Jim Malatras in a statement sent out by Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s press office. “Three organizations, campus organizations, have been suspended and we’re going to be tough not because we want to ruin their fun, but this is a different time and this goes to what other campuses have been doing.” The campus is going virtual for two weeks, the statement also notes, and Cuomo is deploying a “SWAT team” which includes 71 contact tracers.
Students “gathering” off campus: Leadership at the University of Notre Dame, where there have now been nearly 600 cases, explained in a statement that “the vast majority of the positive cases” discovered the week of Aug. 9 “can be traced to a SINGLE off-campus gathering” where “individuals … were both outside and inside, together for some time, not wearing masks, in a crowded space, and drinking.” Notre Dame later suspended in-person classes for a two-week period and announced that it would begin regularly testing students. At Georgia College, where 7 percent of the student body is infected, in-person classes are ongoing, reports Inside Higher Ed, but officials said in a statement to the news outlet that “we continue to remind our students that COVID-19 can spread rapidly at off-campus social gatherings where social distancing and other mitigation measures are not maintained.”
Students “gathering” ON campus: “Last night, a large group of first-year students selfishly jeopardized the very thing that so many of you claim to want from Syracuse University—that is, a chance at a residential college experience,” said J. Michael Haynie, Syracuse University’s vice chancellor for strategic initiatives and innovation in an Aug. 20 statement titled “Last Night’s Selfish and Reckless Behavior.” Pictures and video of the gathering spread on social media. The university has not experienced a major outbreak (yet).
Students not wearing masks and breaking social distancing rules: The University of Miami is doling out warnings, fines, and suspensions for students who break safety rules, reports the Miami Herald. Ryan Holmes, associate vice president for student affairs and dean of students, told the Herald that depending on how extreme the case was, students could be suspended for breaking coronavirus rules. He didn’t specify how much the fines were, but in Miami, you can be fined $50 by the city for a first offense of going maskless. The school has found 183 positive cases since Aug. 17.
Too many people on campus. Following outbreaks, an announcement from Kevin M. Guskiewicz, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill chancellor, and Robert A. Blouin, executive vice chancellor, explained that the school was making “important changes to de-densify our campus.” (Namely, undergrad classes would go online for the entire semester, and students would be allowed to cancel their dorm room leases without penalty.) The reasoning Guskiewicz and Blouin use here is notable because it acknowledges the reality that students, many of them teenagers away from home for the first time, with limited support to combat loneliness and due to COVID boredom, will end up prioritizing the wrong thing. And it helps underscore the reality that the virus thrives when lots of people live in close quarters. Which brings me to the last, best thing to blame …
We are simply in a pandemic. After logging 263 positive tests in one week, East Carolina University switched to an online semester. Before the uptick, interim chancellor Ron Mitchelson had scolded some students for being “unmasked“ and “irresponsible.” But in an Aug. 23 statement, his messaging shifted to acknowledge the larger reality this semester exists within. He said in a video statement to the community: “The decision to pivot in large part was the disease. It’s a horrible pandemic that we face. We couldn’t stand by any longer.”
And there it is: an actual change in infrastructure that takes into account the fact that we are living in a pandemic. It’s probably the only chance colleges have to get out of this mess.

131,https://www.chicagotribune.com/nation-world/ct-nw-college-towns-coronavirus-20200828-j4m3enp5ofgzbkirb52r64pjre-story.html,-1.327,Tensions rise between college towns and universities as outbreaks emerge among students returning to campus,"RALEIGH, N.C. — As more and more schools and businesses around the country get the OK to reopen, college towns are moving in the opposite direction because of too much partying and too many COVID-19 infections among students.
With more than 300 students at the University of Missouri testing positive for the coronavirus and an alarming 44% positivity rate for the surrounding county, the local health director Friday ordered bars to stop serving alcohol at 9 p.m. and close by 10 p.m.
Earlier this week, Iowa’s governor ordered all bars shut down around Iowa University and Iowa State, while the mayor of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, did the same in the hometown of the state’s flagship university.
“What we’re seeing in our violations is they’re coming late at night,” said Stephanie Browning, head of the health department for Columbia, Missouri. “Big groups gathering. They’re not wearing their masks, they’re not social distancing.”
In Provo, Utah, the home of Brigham Young University, the Municipal Council passed a mask ordinance over the mayor’s veto because of the influx of students from around the country for the start of classes Monday.
The outbreaks since students began returning to campus in the past few weeks have heightened town-gown tensions and led to recriminations between local politicians and university officials.
Meanwhile, California announced a four-tiered, color-coded plan Friday for gradually reopening businesses. It requires counties to meet certain benchmarks showing progress in controlling the virus. Gov. Gavin Newsom abandoned a reopening attempt earlier this summer because of a surge in cases.
In Arizona, another deadly hot spot this summer, a drop in transmission numbers allowed the Phoenix and Tucson areas to reopen gyms and some bars on Thursday. And Ohio let theater groups this week resume performances with strict audience caps.
The U.S. has recorded over 180,000 deaths from the coronavirus and 5.9 million confirmed infections. Worldwide, the death toll is put at more than 830,000, with at least 24.5 million cases.
Surging infection numbers around the U.S. have been blamed in part on young people ignoring mask and social distancing requirements.
Browning, who also slapped a 20-person limit on crowds, said the percentage of tests coming back positive for the virus in the county is roughly four times higher than before students returned to classes. Chancellor Mun Choi said the university is not considering going to online-only classes, but it is canceling some events, including the homecoming parade in October.
In Iowa’s Story County, where Iowa State is situated, 74% of new cases over the past seven days were among people ages 19 to 24, Gov. Kim Reynolds said Thursday. In the same time period, 69% of new cases in Johnson County, the home of the University of Iowa, were in that age group.
“It is increasing the virus activity in the community, and it’s spilling over to other segments of the population,” Reynolds said.
The University of Alabama has recorded over 500 cases of COVID-19 on campus since the fall semester began last week. In closing the town’s bars Monday for the next two weeks, Mayor Walt Maddox said that an unchecked spread of the virus threatens both the health care system and the local economy if students have to be sent home for the semester for remote learning.
Three of North Carolina’s largest public universities have abruptly halted in-person undergraduate instruction and directed students to move out of the dorms after hundreds tested positive following their return to campus. Nearly 800 have been confirmed infected at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, more than 670 at North Carolina State and around 300 at East Carolina University.
Leaders at UNC-Chapel Hill, which has shifted to online classes, wrote an open letter Thursday to the mayor outlining steps the university is taking to curb off-campus parties, including disciplinary measures and combined patrols between campus and town police.
“We recognize the very real problems with the behaviors of some of our fraternities and sororities,” the university’s chancellor and provost assured the mayor.
Chapel Hill’s mayor and members of the Town Council had written to the school last week urging it to expand virus testing, update its infection figures more often and spell out what discipline students would face for violating school rules and local ordinances. The local leaders decried the “vacuum left by the university’s decision to take minimal responsibility for students when they are off campus.”
Oyeronke Popoola, a 17-year-old freshman at UNC-Chapel Hill who moved out of her dorm, said that administrators, not students, deserve most of the blame for the virus-related problems after they ushered students back to campus.
“They should’ve put everything online from the beginning, but they wanted the money,” she said. And she said fraternities and sororities weren’t the only ones at fault among the students: “I feel like Greek life gets a lot of blame, which is understandable, but there are other students who were meeting without masks that were not a part of Greek life.”
Elsewhere around the world, the British government encouraged workers to return to their offices amid concerns that working from home is hurting coffee shops, restaurants and other businesses in city centers. The government plans to launch a media campaign next week to help reassure the public.
Italy reported nearly 1,500 new infections Friday, its highest day-to-day increase since May, even as the country moves toward reopening schools in two weeks.
Two other European countries moved to restrict travel, with Hungary announcing it will close its borders to foreigners and Greece suspending flights from Barcelona and other airports in northern Spain because of a spike in infections there."

The university first announced last week that it was investigating reports of two parties at the former Kappa Alpha fraternity house on Aug. 21 and Aug. 22. As a precaution, school officials told 53 students who attended the parties to quarantine while they get tested for the virus.
On Friday, eight students who were at the parties had tested positive.
By Wednesday, the university said 59 people reported they were at the parties and that 32 of them were students who tested positive for COVID-19 after attending the events.
Tom Evelyn, vice president for communications with the university, said the school is still waiting on several test results from others who were in attendance and that most of the students are quarantining off campus.
'We don't want to become the super-spreader':Citing COVID-19, Clemson Greek life goes virtual
In the announcement on Wednesday, the university said there was a delay in contact tracing because the school was not initially provided ""information about the events at the house and the individuals present.""
""An outbreak that surpasses our ability to quarantine is one trigger that could cause us to go fully remote, and this matter quickly became an issue of wellbeing for our entire community,"" the announcement said.
Furman brought freshmen and seniors back on campus Aug. 12-15, while sophomores and juniors are set to return Sept. 11-13. The university has 2,320 students enrolled, including 252 students who are attending the college online.
The university eliminated fraternity housing last year, meaning students are unable to live in or host events at the houses.
Kappa Alpha had just gotten off of probation at the university in the spring because of several unregistered events in April 2019 in Hilton Head that included alcohol. The university said students who were involved in the 2019 incidents were also involved in the house parties two weeks ago.
""While the organizational climate did not meet Furman’s conduct expectations, these men will remain a part of our community after the conduct matters are concluded. We ask that they be treated with respect,"" the university's announcement said.
The university said the fraternity will have the opportunity to appeal the suspension.
Jesse Lyons, assistant executive director for advancement for the national Kappa Alpha Order, released a statement that said the Furman chapter had made a ""serious mistake,"" but that the organization would support their efforts to appeal the suspension.
""Kappa Alpha Order continues to advise all our members to follow campus, community, CDC, and state guidelines regarding Covid-19. The Furman chapter made a serious mistake, which we are seeing happen across the country when young people are returning to their campuses for the first time in five months,"" the statement said. ""We will work with the Furman chapter as they consider next steps, and will support them as they submit an appeal to the school’s decision.""

After a rise in COVID-19 cases when students returned to classes, officials with the University of Alabama and the University of Alabama System are detailing their preparations and said it's likely safer for students to remain on campus.
Dr. Richard Friend, dean of UA’s College of Community Health Sciences, spoke with members of the media via Zoom on Wednesday, saying ""Nothing has gone wrong"" with the UA approach as far as testing, sanitation and distancing measures in campus buildings, and preparations for quarantine and isolation space.
Later that afternoon, a news release came from the UA System office quoting Dr. Mike Saag, professor of medicine in the University of Alabama at Birmingham Division of Infectious Diseases, and UAB Senior Vice President for Medicine and School of Medicine Dean Selwyn Vickers, both members of the UA System Health and Safety Task Force.
The release suggested it's safer to keep students on campus, where they have greater access to resources than the general public, than send students to various homes, where they could potentially spread the virus.
“There is a strong feeling among public health and infectious disease experts that it is safer to keep students on a college campus where there is COVID-19 spread rather than closing campus and sending students home en masse,” Saag was quoted as saying in the release.
In UA quarantine housing, Friend said, students have around-the-clock security, a medical liaison on call, and access to mental health resources. Campus-wide, UA can provide testing, PPE and other healthcare assistance.
“The risk in closing a college campus and forcing thousands of students home at once is that the virus then has the opportunity to spread more widely to other geographic locations and possibly more vulnerable populations,"" Saag said in the release.
Although positive COVID-19 tests have risen in Tuscaloosa since classes resumed in mid-August, Friend said there's no evidence any viral transmission has occurred in a UA classroom, and that there are no reports of students being hospitalized.
The online dashboard counter for the UA system tracks 158 COVID-19 positive cases on the UA campus from Jan. 1 to Aug. 18, with 562 from Aug. 19 to 24, and 481 from Aug. 25-27, for a total of 1,201.
UAB's numbers were similar from January to Aug. 18, with 147 positives, but the Birmingham campus saw just one positive from Aug. 19-24, and nine from Aug. 25-27, for a total of 157.
At the University of Alabama in Huntsville, those numbers are zero, eight and two, for a total of 10. Dashboard figures are viewable at www.uasystem.edu/covid-19-dashboard/
""We (UA) have the largest campus in the state,"" Friend said, ""we have approximately 40,000 students, 6,000 faculty and staff, and we anticipated the quarantine and isolation space we needed, I think with great foresight, early in June.""
UA's isolation and quarantine space is at 36.09 percent occupancy, according to the dashboard, while UAB has zero percent occupancy, and UAB 11.5 percent occupancy of its isolation space.
Sentinel testing, sampling 2.5 to 4 percent of all students, faculty and staff, will begin at UA next week. Where it's already begun, with UAB academic faculty and staff, there have been zero out of 351 Sentinel positives, and for UAB clinical enterprise employees, two positives out of 1,275 Sentinel tests, for .16 percent positives.
""We know of no other university or university system with a more comprehensive testing plan, or one that has devoted more resources to testing, since our students arrived on campus,"" Friend said.
It's incumbent on everyone in all the campus communities to take personal responsibility, he said.
""I believe we have a real opportunity to reverse these trends, but it will take the full commitment of our students as I know they want to remain on campus, and that is a goal I believe we all share,"" he said.
Vickers echoed that in the release, saying ""Student behavior and compliance are some of the fundamental components of managing the outbreak.""
Risk-mitigation strategies can help flatten the curve, Friend said.
""We are able to operate safely with those tools, we're constantly refining our plans,"" he said. ""...The virus is really dictating where we are and how we move next.""
The UA System updates dashboard numbers each Friday. At Tuesday's Tuscaloosa City Council meeting, Mayor Walt Maddox spoke of waiting for this week's numbers before deciding if his 14-day bar-closing order, set to expire at 5 p.m. Monday, will end then, or need to be extended. UA confers with Maddox daily, as well as with DCH Regional Medical Center, Friend said.
On Aug. 21, UA President Stuart R. Bell announced temporary directives restricting social gatherings in Greek houses, and in housing and residential communities, and a 14-day moratorium on all in-person student events outside of classroom instruction, social or otherwise.
""The additional measures enacted by the campus and the city,"" Friend said, ""to limit student activities and close the bars, are critical.""
But measurement of their effectiveness remains to be seen, he added.
""I remain cautiously optimistic we’re heading in the right direction, but truly we’re not going to see the results of all our efforts until after Labor Day and possibly the week after that,"" he said.
""We have great concern about social gatherings off-campus, and I know the university has ramped up compliance efforts to help keep the campus community safe.""
Friend also addressed oncoming flu season, and suggested people get vaccinated beginning in mid-September.
""That is the next worst concern on my mind. and we’re already planning for it,"" he said, ""UA has purchased over 10,000 doses of flu vaccine"" to be administered by the College of Community Health Sciences. He noted that in Australia they're showing the lowest flu counts on record, and that social distancing and masking are ""no doubt playing a part in that.""
""As a clinician, as a hospital staff member, I certainly worry about the impact of flu and COVID together,"" he said.

MADISON, Wis. (WMTV) - For many UW Madison students and parents, the COVID-19 dashboard is their main source for information.
“It is far from a Freshman year to go there and be hunkered down in your dorms,” said UW Madison parent, Laurie Frumiento.
Frumiento, whose daughter is a freshman, lives in Maine. She said she is doing the best she can to keep up with what is going on at the campus from across the country. One of the ways she does that is through the dashboard.
“It’s one of those things where you don’t really know the right answer. Is the right answer to stay home, is the right answer to go?” she said.
Ajay Sethi, a UW Madison associate professor in population sciences who works on the dashboard, said while universities do not have to report the information, they know it is important to do so.
“Dashboards are common, and I think transparency is paramount right now during our pandemic,"" he said.
NBC15′s national investigative team, InvestigateTV, poured over more than 100 COVID-19 dashboard websites from large universities across the country to see what information is shared and how.
From displaying total positive and negative cases, to reporting isolated and quarantined students, the UW checked almost every box InvestigateTV looked into for transparency.
“I think it is important that the campus and broader communities have a centralized place to go and find out more about COVID-19, the cases on campus and also the universities response,"" Sethi said.
However, UW’s dashboard does not include active and recovered cases. Sethi explained they can only track data to a certain point.
“Once a person tests positive for COVID, if their symptoms are going to require a hospitalization for example, we are not privy to that information and it is not sort of under our purview,"" he said. “Hospitalizations are reported to Public Health Madison Dane Co. and the state. If we learn of a hospitalization and subsequent recovery, it is because the person who tested positive and was hospitalized disclosed that information to us.""
Of the 107 schools InvestigateTV looked at, only 25 percent reported active cases. Less than half of the schools report the number of isolated students. UW Madison is one of them.
“For those who are in isolation, by tracking that, that essentially is our active cases,"" Sethi said.
Dr. Howard Forman from Yale School of Public Health, has tracked national trends and created a website grading universities on their COVID-19 dashboards.
“Many of these universities are like small cities. So you’re dealing in some cases, like Wisconsin, like Ohio State, some Florida schools, some Texas schools, with 30 or 40 thousand people who are living on one campus. And sometimes when you hear about a massive outbreak you may think that it’s widespread across the campus, but it could be that two dormitories are badly infected, and everyone else is actually doing pretty well,” Dr. Forman said.
The UW earned a B+, for things like being east to read and updated daily. UW Madison experts explain they are meeting on a daily basis to find ways to best provide the information.
“Our rating was done on September 1, and actually on September 3 we integrated information from Public Health Madison Dane Co. into our figures,” Sethi said.
Frumiento said she and her daughter rely on the transparency to get through.
“The information that we have been getting, and I think her comfort there she has nothing but faith in the information she is receiving,"" Frumiento said.
Two schools scored higher than UW. Both the University of Maryland and Michigan received an A-.

With totals reported Thursday, Georgia is close to 301,000 COVID-19 cases since the start of the pandemic in March. There also are now 6,474 total confirmed deaths caused by the respiratory illness.
Georgia’s numbers continue mostly to improve, although cases, hospitalizations, and deaths remain elevated over June before numbers began to spike. Hospitalizations continue to fall. The number of confirmed cases in hospitals is below 1,500, down more than half from the peak of 3,200 in late July.
And new deaths being recorded are also dropping, down about 40% since early September to below 40 a day.
But the seven-day rolling average of new cases has drifted up for several days, and Georgia remains the state with the 12th most new cases per capita in the past 14 days, according to data kept by The Associated Press.
“We seem to have hit a leveling point that might just be a bump on the continued trajectory down,” epidemiologist Amber Schmidtke wrote Wednesday of Georgia’s case trend. “We need more time to know.”
Chattahoochee County, which contains much of Fort Benning, remains the top county nationwide for new cases per capita in the last 14 days. Athens-Clarke County, home to the University of Georgia, ranks No. 14, while Stewart County, home to an immigration detention center, ranks No. 20.
Those hot spots are reflected in larger statewide trends that show COVID-19 cases spiking among people aged 18-22, the age for traditional college students and many military trainees.
Fulton and Gwinnett counties remain the counties with the highest number of total COVID-19 cases, with over 26,000 confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic.
Transmission at schools remain high, according to state figures, accounting for 39 of the 93 outbreaks reported last week. Beyond young adults, COVID-19 remains high among school-aged children in some counties, with more than 5 infections per 1,000 school-aged children reported in 10 counties, mostly in east central or southeast Georgia.

The school found elevated amounts of Covid-19 in wastewater samples collected from four residence halls on campus.
Officials issued a safety alert on Sunday calling for mandatory testing and quarantine of all 287 students living in Rich, Jones, Morgan and Davis on-campus residence halls.
Classes started Monday at the school and some of the students had just moved into their rooms.
The mandatory quarantine is effective immediately and will continue until the test results are returned. USU also activated a Covid care team to arrange for resources to assist the affected students, including meal deliveries.
Wastewater sampling began July 1 and provides an early alert warning to address potential cases, said Amanda DeRito, a director with the university.
""The benefit of testing the water is that we get a snapshot into what is happening on campus and can quarantine even before a student becomes symptomatic. It is also less invasive,"" DeRito said.
No other testing samples on campus taken this week show elevated levels of the virus and there are currently no reported positive tests for Covid-19 in the quarantined residence halls, according to a university press release.
In mid-August, the CDC announced creation of the National Wastewater Surveillance System to help local public health leaders better understand the extent of the spread of the pandemic in their communities.
Sewage from house and workplaces can be tested for genetic material from the novel coronavirus. Studies show the virus can be found in feces from people who are sick and also from people who don't yet have Covid-19 symptoms.
Testing for all Americans a 'utopian' idea, administration official says
Adm. Brett Giroir, the Trump administration's coronavirus testing czar, on Tuesday dismissed the idea of daily Covid-19 tests for all Americans as ""utopian.""
""It's great to talk about this utopian kind of idea where everybody has a test every day and we can do that,"" Giroir said. ""I don't live in a utopian world. I live in the real world, and the real world had no tests for this new disease when this first started.""
The assistant secretary for health at the US Department of Health and Human Services said that the country now has a ""huge diversity"" of tests, including a $5 point of care test that provides results within 15 minutes.
""There is no stone unturned, there is no technology that we're not looking at or investing in if it's promising,"" Giroir said. ""We can return to society without having everyone have a test every single day. We can do that. We're showing we can do that.
""There may be a time where everybody can wake up in the morning, pass through a tricorder and tell whether they're infected or not,"" Giroir said, referring to the fictional handheld device from ""Star Trek"" that could scan people for data. ""We are not there yet.""
Testing availability and speed has improved in the US, particularly since the disastrous spring delays. Giroir said 91.9% of results from major referral labs, which do about half the tests in the US, were completed in three days. The mean turnaround time in August for large referral labs was 2.27 days.
Still, that 2.27-day average delay allows the virus to quietly spread, and public health and lab industry experts have repeatedly called on the federal government to take a larger leadership role in coordinating testing supplies.
US Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, the House majority whip, responded to Giroir's comments by saying, ""It would not be utopian if we had a national program to combat this pandemic. It may be going state by state. But one national program would not be utopian at all.""
CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen indicated that Giroir was attacking a straw man. Testing is an important part of public health strategy, but no one seriously argues testing can solve everything alone.
""He says, 'People say we can test our way out of the pandemic.' I have never heard anyone seriously say that,"" Cohen said. ""He needs to stop making up these boogie men who he's fighting against. No one is telling him we need a utopia. We're just telling him he needs to do better.""
Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, noted on Twitter that the White House staff has widespread testing, as do sports leagues such as the NFL.
""It's not utopia to want to test teachers & kids to return to school, nursing home residents to stay alive, first responders and other essential workers,"" he wrote. ""Sure, lets call it utopia when it's for the less privileged.""
Dire warnings for Iowa
A White House coronavirus task force report sent to officials in the state of Iowa this week warned of dire new case increases across rural and urban areas and called for a mask mandate, the closure of bars, and for university towns to do more as the pandemic intensifies in the Midwest.
CNN has obtained the nine-page August 30 report for the state, first reported by the Des Moines Register, from the Iowa Department of Public Health. The task force releases state-by-state reports each week to governors' offices, and has so far declined to make them publicly available.
The report says that Iowa is in the task force-defined ""red zone"" and warns that the state has the highest rate of cases in the US, which increased by 77.4% from the previous week.
Campus outbreaks
In the report, the task force points to universities as a major factor contributing to the virus's spread.
The three counties with the highest numbers of cases also have large student populations: Story County, home to Iowa State, and Johnson County, home to University of Iowa, as well as Polk County, which contains Iowa's largest metro area, Des Moines.
The university crossed the 1,000 active case mark on August 29 when it reported 302 cases in a single day. The overall current case load, including employees, is 1,026.
Other schools reported outbreaks.
At the University of South Carolina, 1,017 students currently have Covid-19, according to the university's coronavirus dashboard, making it one of the highest case counts recorded at a college so far.
Despite the climbing active case count and the fact that 60% of the university's designated quarantine space is in use, according to its dashboard, the school still lists its' alert level as ""low.""
The University of Missouri has 424 active student Covid-19 cases, according to the school's Covid-19 dashboard. James Madison University is reporting 138 new Covid-19 positive cases among its students and employees since Monday, according the JMU dashboard.
More than 20,000 cases of Covid-19 among students and staff have been reported at colleges and universities across at least 36 states, according to a CNN tally.
The campus reopenings represent new coronavirus hot spots in a country with plenty enough already as the US surpassed 6 million total confirmed cases on Monday.
NIH rejects plasma treatment
A National Institutes of Health panel said there's no evidence backing the use of convalescent plasma to treat coronavirus patients and that doctors should not treat it as a standard of care until more study has been done.
""There are insufficient data to recommend either for or against the use of convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19,"" the panel of more than three dozen experts said in a statement posted on the NIH website.
The statement, which was posted quietly, contradicts the Trump administration's characterization of the treatment as ""historic"" and a ""major advance"" and directly refers to last week's emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration.
Also Tuesday, an independent committee said any eventual coronavirus vaccine should go first to the people most at risk of catching it.
The draft report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine makes recommendations similar to those that have come from other groups, but it goes into detail to explain why health workers, for instance, should be among the first to get a vaccine."

Across the United States, at least 36 states have reported positive cases at colleges and universities, adding more than 8,700 cases to the country’s tally. More than 5.9 million infections have been recorded in the United States, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Since classes started on August 19, 1,200 students at the University of Alabama have tested positive for the virus, the university system’s website showed Saturday. Classes at the University of Dayton will continue online for at least two weeks after the school reported 116 case on Thursday and then another 148 on Friday, according to the university’s website.
Outbreaks have been identified at four different sororities at Kansas State University, according to news releases from the college and the Riley County Health Department.
Providence College in Rhode Island has implemented policies to prevent the virus’ spread, but 17 students have been placed on “interim suspension” for violating those measures, meaning they will not be allowed on campus or in classes until they attend a hearing, college spokesperson Steven Maurano told CNN Saturday.
“I am deeply disappointed by the selfish behavior of these students who defiantly chose to ignore our COVID-19 Code of Conduct,” Fr. Kenneth R. Sicard, O.P., the college’s president, said in a statement. “While I find no joy in having to endorse such strong sanctions, I know they are necessary if we are going to have a successful fall semester.”
California surpasses 700,000 cases
California, which has more coronavirus cases than any other state, surpassed 700,000 cases on Saturday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
The state has reported 12,894 deaths from the virus.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced this week that the state will implement a slower, more cautious approach to allowing businesses and activities to resume, after quick reopenings in the spring led to a dramatic rise in infections and deaths.
“We’re going to be more stubborn this time, and have a mandatory wait time between moves,” Newsom said Friday. “We didn’t do that last time.”
California saw a resurgence in cases in June, and Newsom began shutting down much of the economy for a second time. But in recent weeks, the average number of new daily cases has fallen, paving the way for a new reopening plan.
Part of going forward under coronavirus in the state will be a continued eviction moratorium, Newsom announced during a news conference Friday.
The existing moratorium — accommodating millions of tenants who are at risk of eviction as well as landlords that are not able to pay their mortgages — was set to expire September 1. Newsom did not provide details of the new agreement, but said he looked “forward to signing it very very shortly.”
Louisiana worries about a drop in testing after Hurricane Laura
After part of his state was walloped by Hurricane Laura last week, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards is worried that the storm will lead to a decline in coronavirus testing in the state.
Southwest Louisiana has the highest ratio of positive tests and was hit the hardest by the hurricane, Edwards said at a news conference.
“We have tens of thousands of people from southwest Louisiana who are scattered all over the state taking shelter,” Edwards said. “So we don’t know exactly what this is going to look like” as far the spread of Covid-19, he added.
The governor said that 6,200 members of the National Guard were in the state assisting with recovery from the hurricane, but he was eager to get them back on the Covid-19 mission.
“Frankly we cannot afford to lose sight of our testing, because it was about three weeks ago that our schools came back. We have had students back on our college campuses,” Edwards said. “So, this is a very bad week for us not to be doing robust testing.”
Remdesivir extended to all hospitalized patients
This week brought hopeful news to those hospitalized with coronavirus.
The US Food and Drug Administration extended the emergency use authorization for a drug that has been shown to shorten recovery time for all patients hospitalized with coronavirus.
Remdesivir was originally authorized in May only for patients with severe infections who needed help breathing with extra oxygen or mechanical ventilation. But the emergency use now applies to a wider group of patients.
“The data show that this treatment has the potential to help even more hospitalized patients who are suffering from the effects of this devastating virus,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said in a statement."

""When we begin to look at the possibility of community transmission within schools, we need to think about social distancing, and there's not enough social distancing happening within classrooms. We still have large class sizes,"" said James Bedford, president of the Manitoba Teachers' Society.
Health officials are trying to find out how an outbreak of the virus started at John Pritchard School in Winnipeg, where the province has confirmed seven cases among students and staff.
Bedford says many teachers have told him that their classes are either the same size or larger than last year. He wants the province to use some of the combined $185 million in provincial and federal funding at its disposal to hire more staff to support remote learning in order to reduce class sizes.
Last month, Education Minister Kelvin Goertzen announced the province would put up $52 million, in addition to $48 million school divisions had saved after in-class learning was suspended this spring, to pay for extra sanitization, personal protective equipment, and hiring more substitute teachers.
The announcement made no mention of hiring more staff to reduce class sizes.
The federal government also pledged $85.4 million for Manitoba to help with school reopenings, but it remains unclear how the province intends to spend that money.
""I think that money needs to be spent here in Manitoba, and it needs to be spent quickly here in Manitoba to reduce those class sizes,"" Bedford said.
'Scary' outbreak in school
Several parents that CBC News spoke to expressed concern that more wasn't being done to make class sizes smaller in Manitoba schools.
""It's just to me, it's a no brainer. Classes are sometimes much too big,"" said Agnes Warkentin, whose son is enrolled in Garden Valley Collegiate in Winkler, Man.
""I think that the crowded classrooms are just going to exponentiate the COVID- 19 problem that we are already starting to see. And the classes need to be half the size.""
Courtney Marchant lives in Winnipeg and has a daughter in Grade 5 enrolled in public school, and a son in Grade 7 enrolled in a Catholic school. She says her son's class has 29 students in it.
""He can't get up without bumping into the desk that's in front of him or behind him,"" she said.
The outbreak at John Pritchard School is ""scary,"" she said.
""I know my kids are wondering, you know, 'What's going to happen if I get it? Am I going to die?'""
Marchant says her family would jump at the chance to do remote learning, as neither she nor her husband have the capacity to homeschool their children.
Heather Didora lives in Oak Bluff, Man. and has two children, including one child in Grade 1. She questions why schools haven't adopted the two-metre physical distancing standard recommended by health experts. Instead, the province has called for a minimum of one metre between students, a standard that is still hard to achieve given current class sizes.
""I fully support my child being in school,"" she said. ""But I'm very disappointed in the overall lack … of support and planning that the provincial government has provided.""
Didora wants to see mobile pods brought in to help schools provide more space for classes.
Bedford says the cases in Manitoba schools have increased anxiety among staff.
""Just because we accept early on that incidences like this are going to happen in our schools, it doesn't make it any easier for the people going through it."""
143,https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2020/09/17/new-york-city-reverses-school-opening-plan-now-most-students-will-start-remotely/,-1.6480000000000001,New York City reverses school opening plan. Now most students will start remotely.,"NEW YORK — Four days before students were set to arrive at school buildings, Mayor Bill de Blasio said he would again delay face-to-face instruction for nearly all students as the school system, which educates more than 1 million youths, scrambled to assuage growing fears among educators and parents.
Under the latest plan, in-person learning would begin for preschoolers and special-education students Monday, with other students joining over the next two weeks.
De Blasio (D) had pledged to provide parents the option to send their children back to school for at least part of the week, allowing for social distancing, and provide virtual instruction the rest of the time. School buildings were set to reopen Monday.
But he faced significant pushback from many teachers and parents, who expressed concern about whether schools could adequately prevent a coronavirus outbreak, with many buildings having poor ventilation systems. There were also concerns about whether schools had enough personal protective equipment, such as masks.
New York City is being closely watched as it looks to reopen its schools. The city was traumatized with one of the nation’s worst coronavirus outbreaks, and many students return to classes having lost relatives or with memories of unending emergency sirens.
Elsewhere, some school reopenings have been marred by infections emerging among students and staffers. Many states have reopened schools despite high infection rates, in some cases because they were required by state leaders. President Trump and his allies have pushed for schools to reopen.
Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) forced most schools to reopen, saw 10,000 new pediatric infections the first two weeks of school, the Florida Department of Health reported.
Thursday’s announcement by de Blasio adds another layer of a chaos to a process that has already been fraught with tension and anxiety. Last month, New York City teachers laid out health and safety demands and threatened to strike if they were not met. They eventually struck a deal with the city for monthly randomized testing of students and staffers to keep the pandemic in check within schools. The city also pushed the start date — originally set for Sept. 10 — back to Monday.
But there were signs that the plan — which allows parents to choose remote learning or a blend of in-person and virtual classes, and allows teachers with medical waivers to work from home — was fraying.
About 42 percent of students opted for the fully remote option. Those who wanted to return to buildings would do so only part time and in cohorts to allow for social distancing, and would get virtual instruction on other days.
Some schools had so many teachers qualify for medical waivers to teach from home that they did not have enough for in-person instruction. So they planned to have students in front of laptops, learning virtually from a teacher giving lessons from home. It also meant that not all students would get live instruction.
This week, de Blasio announced that 55 teachers had tested positive for the coronavirus, just as some were starting to arrive back at buildings to set up their classrooms.
De Blasio said staffing issues were a major factor in his decision to delay the start. He plans to hire 4,500 additional teachers.
“We’re giving schools more staff, more time and more support, and this helps us give us the strongest possible start to the most unconventional school year any of us have ever experienced,” Chancellor Richard A. Carranza said.
Now, only preschoolers and special-education students will start in-person instruction Monday. On Sept. 29, elementary schools (both K-5 and K-8) will begin in-person classes, while the rest will go back Oct. 1, de Blasio said.
New York City, home to the nation’s largest school system, is one of the only urban districts to reopen school buildings for face-to-face instruction. School leaders argued it was critical for children, many of whom rely on schools for meals and for a safe place to stay during the day.
Once the nation’s epicenter of the pandemic, New York City has seen positivity rates fall below 1 percent. By contrast, the nation’s positivity rate stands at more than 5 percent.
An earlier version of this report misstated de Blasio’s reopening plan. The mayor had planned to allow only some students to return Monday."

Whitney Soule, Bowdoin College
(THE CONVERSATION) The coronavirus pandemic has intensified college application anxiety. I make this observation as an admissions dean who, as of late, has not just been answering emails and questions from parents. Instead, I’m also responding to media inquiries about how my school plans to manage our selection processes in this crisis.
All of these questions hint at an underlying concern that the disruption could be an automatic disadvantage. In reality, many colleges already take a student’s circumstances into account.
Based on what I know about how college admission works, here are five things I believe that students and families ought to know when they apply to colleges during the pandemic.
1. Admissions officers will understand if grades are incomplete
In the emergency pivot to online learning in the spring of 2020, some schools stopped grading students. In many cases, these schools adopted other measures to show that students completed the academic year.
Many members of the class of 2021 and other college applicants are afraid that the absence of grades – from all or part of the 2019-2020 school year – could hurt their admission chances, when at least some other applicants have those grades.
This is not necessarily new. Some high schools don’t ever assign grades, so colleges review a transcript that consists purely of their teachers’ comments. Other students have attended multiple high schools, which means that their transcripts have different grading scales.
Bottom line: All of the academic work leading up to the pandemic still matters and can help frame the work in the past couple of months.
2. Entrance exams could be less important than usual
Since the spring, the SAT and ACT canceled test dates, and most students have limited options if they want to take rescheduled tests. With the uneven availability of the two most common entrance exams, hundreds of colleges and universities are at least temporarily taking the test-optional approach Bowdoin College first introduced in 1969. The University of California system is going even further by becoming test-blind, meaning the school won’t review SAT or ACT scores, even if students do submit them.
Yet students are still worried that without SAT or ACT results they won’t be competitive. Or if they took a test, and didn’t have a chance to try again, their scores don’t seem strong enough. They can take some comfort in that almost 400 colleges have stated that the lack of test scores is not an admissions disadvantage.
Likewise, Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate testing was disrupted. Students who had dedicated nearly a year to their AP classes lurched into the spring facing tests that were quickly reconfigured in online format. The IB tests scheduled for May were canceled. I’m hearing that many students are worried about whether their test results, if they got them at all, will hold up to admissions scrutiny.
Again, they may be able to take comfort from the fact that hundreds of colleges recognize this predicament. Specifically, these colleges have signed an agreement that states the absence of AP or IB results will not put applicants at a disadvantage, and that they will “view students in the context of the curriculum, academic resources and supports available to them.”
3. It’s OK if students get a letter of recommendation from teachers they know only online
Many colleges require a recommendation from a teacher. Admissions officers rely on these recommendations for insight into the student’s learning style and strengths. Since many schools have gone to remote learning, teachers may not get as much insight into a student as they did when they were teaching in person.
But even in that situation, teachers can characterize the student as a learner in an online environment, which is a valuable insight. As Lee Coffin, dean of admissions at Dartmouth College, told me via text message: “These cyber-relationships are another type of new normal, so we are interested in the teacher’s view on how this works for a student.”
4. Personality may count more than before
Student activities such as sports, performing arts, community service and jobs aren’t immune to the pandemic.
For some students, the challenges of COVID-19 are just an interference with their daily lives. For others, the disease and its consequences are absolutely traumatic, with sick family members and financial crises. Depending on circumstances, some students might be able to list all of their activities because they were not interrupted. For others, the list could look blank since March.
Fortunately, even before the pandemic, there has been a movement among college admissions officers to begin to consider factors such as empathy and persistence, which we could notice in the hours a student commits to a school commute, or a teacher’s testament to working well with classmates, or maybe as seen through an essay.
Some have followed specific recommendations for new ways to admit students that were made by Harvard’s Making Caring Common project. This is good news for students because it signals that admissions officers value students’ unique qualities beyond their academics and extracurricular activities.
5. The effects of gap-year students will vary
As colleges rolled out their plans for fall semester, many incoming first-year students – anywhere from 4% to 20% at various schools – chose to take a gap year.
In most cases, those gap-year students intend to enroll at colleges and universities that already accepted them in the spring of 2020. As a result, schools will hold their place and let them begin as first-years in the fall of 2021. While that is good news for students who want to wait, it also means that there may be fewer spaces available for students graduating from high school in 2021 who intend to begin their college educations in the fall of 2021.
The degree to which this situation changes the outlook for admissions will vary from school to school. Some of my counterparts – such as Jeremiah Quinlan, admissions dean at Yale, and Liz Creighton, admissions dean at Williams College – have told me they’re just planning to welcome larger first-year classes in the fall of 2021.
At Bowdoin, our small number of deferring students won’t significantly impact the spaces we can offer.
Going forth
These disruptions might alter the way college applications are evaluated, but – in my view – colleges are up for the challenge and prepared to be sensitive and flexible.
I would suggest that students and their families accept the disruptions for what they are, instead of getting too worried about them. High school seniors should devote their energy and time to the parts of their college applications that they can complete, not those that are impossible to do because of ongoing disruptions to everyday life.

More than 500 Jordan School District students and employees have been asked to quarantine after they were in close contact with someone infected with COVID-19, a letter to parents in the district stated.
As of Wednesday, there were 20 active COVID-19 cases in the district, which includes more than 56,000 students and at least 6,000 employees.
Jordan district spokeswoman Sandy Riesgraf said schools are prepared to shift affected students to remote learning for the duration of the quarantine.
Schools have contingency plans for a reason
At least three schools in Utah, including Pleasant Grove High School and two charter schools — the Utah Military Academy and American Preparatory Academy’s Draper location — have halted classroom teaching or altered scheduling due to campus COVID-19 outbreaks.
Meanwhile, Utah State University officials have learned that more than 80% of its 287 students living in quarantined dormitory rooms did not test positive with COVID-19. Four students have self-reported positive test results, according to USU spokeswoman Emilie Wheeler.
The school is waiting on results from the remaining students, but have released at least 29 rooms from quarantine.
Tami Pyfer, who serves as Gov. Gary Herbert’s education adviser, said contingency plans were put in place for this reason and are working well throughout the state as COVID-19 cases are identified.
“Schools need to be flexible, prepared and nimble,” she said, adding that these past few weeks “have been filled with excitement ... but also hesitation and worry.”
Pyfer, who spoke during the governor’s weekly COVID-19 briefing at the state Capitol, pleaded with parents and communities to support their schools and the plans laid out by local districts. She said even if in-person learning doesn’t last, the opportunity to do it even for a short time will have lasting impacts on students and the teachers.
“The flexibility we’re asking for puts a huge burden on families,” Pyfer said. “We believe in the benefits of in-person learning. Enough that we need to try. We need to do our part to keep our schools safe and healthy.”
Salt Lake City to move to yellow phase of recovery
Herbert said on Thursday that Salt Lake City officials and citizens have put in the work to make the move to fewer COVID-19 restrictions, though he clarified, “that doesn’t mean there’s less risk.”
The move will take effect 10 a.m. on Friday.
The primary reason for the state’s gradually reduced risk is to keep the economy going, Herbert said, adding that the color-coded guidance system provides flexibility to businesses and establishments, but also requires responsibility from the public.
“Social distancing and wearing masks is becoming even more important going into the end of this year,” Herbert said during the Capitol briefing.
The governor also granted permission to Sevier County — the 11th county in the state to move to the green category, where there are no restrictions placed on businesses and other establishments in the county. Herbert said both counties have worked with their local health department to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Officials report ‘modest’ increase in cases on Thursday
The Utah Department of Health on Thursday reported another 504 new cases of COVID-19 in Utah, bringing the total number of infections that have been detected since mid-March to 53,326.
The health department estimates that 44,995 people have recovered from their bouts with COVID-19. And, 120 people are currently hospitalized with the disease across the state.
The rolling seven-day average number of daily cases is 394, which is higher than numbers reported in the last couple weeks. The average percent of positive tests is 9.4%, which is three-tenths of a percentage point higher than Wednesday’s average and seven-tenths of a percentage point higher than last Thursday.
“We’re not seeing anything specific that is causing this increase,” Dr. Angela Dunn, state epidemiologist said. She called Thursday’s increase “modest” and encouraged the public “to remain vigilant with prevention measures that we know do work.”
Dunn also warned Utahns to be prepared for the impending influenza season by getting the flu vaccine.
“Now is not too early to get that,” she said. COVID-19, Dunn added, has been more deadly than the flu and has more long-term effects, some of which are still unknown.
“Let’s take every possible measure to protect ourselves and our community this fall so our schools and businesses can stay open,” she said.
Contrary to news released earlier this week from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Utah’s testing capacity has remained robust enough to continue testing asymptomatic people in the state. In fact, Herbert said anyone can and should be tested for COVID-19 if they have even one symptom or otherwise feel the need to be tested.
He said the federal government will soon be sending rapid antigen testing materials to the state, which offers not only a more convenient way to test for COVID-19, but will help provide results much more quickly, even within 15 minutes.
Rapid tests will first go to prioritized groups, including first responders, schools, day care and long-term care facilities, as well as other groups dealing with critical infrastructure.
COVID-19 kills four more in Utah
In addition to the new cases, four more COVID-19 related deaths were reported by the health department, including three Salt Lake County men, two of whom were between ages 45 and 64, and one who was older than 85 years of age. All three were hospitalized at the time of their deaths. Also included in Thursday’s death count was a Utah County man between the ages of 65 and 84, who was also hospitalized at the time of his death.
The state’s death toll from the disease stands at 414.
The state has tested 668,425 people so far, with results from 5,234 people added since Wednesday.
Herbert said Utah is faring well, given the circumstances. He said the state’s unemployment rate is the best in the nation and that Utah’s economy is rebounding better than most states.
“This really has been a unique time in our history. Not really in anybody’s lifetime have we seen anything like this, that permeates every part of our society,” Herbert said. “We still have room to improve and longer row to hoe before we’re out of this challenge.”
The governor asked that Utahns continue to be mindful of the situation going into the Labor Day weekend, which he said for many is “the last opportunity to have fun in the sun and socialize with others.”
“Be careful, not foolish,” Herbert said. “Together, we can get on top of this.”

A return to campus for the new academic year has colleges and universities struggling to both contain outbreaks of COVID-19 and enforce policies meant to prevent its spread.
Across the United States, at least 36 states have reported positive cases at colleges and universities, adding more than 8,700 cases to the country's overall tally.
More than 5.9 million infections have been recorded in the United States, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Since classes started on Aug. 19, 1,200 students at the University of Alabama have tested positive for the virus, the university system's website showed Saturday. Classes at the University of Dayton will continue online for at least two weeks after the school reported 116 cases on Thursday and then another 148 on Friday, according to the university's website.
Outbreaks have been identified at four different sororities at Kansas State University, according to news releases from the college and the Riley County Health Department.
Providence College in Rhode Island has implemented policies to prevent the virus' spread, but 17 students have been placed on ""interim suspension"" for violating those measures, meaning they will not be allowed on campus or in classes until they attend a hearing, college spokesperson Steven Maurano told CNN Saturday.
""I am deeply disappointed by the selfish behavior of these students who defiantly chose to ignore our COVID-19 Code of Conduct,"" Fr. Kenneth R. Sicard, O.P., the college's president, said in a statement. ""While I find no joy in having to endorse such strong sanctions, I know they are necessary if we are going to have a successful fall semester.""
Over 1,000 students have tested positive for COVID-19 at University of Alabama since classes resumed"
147,https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/canada/herzliah-high-school-will-close-for-two-weeks-because-of-covid-19-outbreak/ar-BB19944W,0.0,Herzliah High School will close for two weeks because of COVID-19 outbreak,"The Montreal public health department has ordered the temporary closing of Herzliah High School following a coronavirus outbreak of at least 15 students and one teacher in what appears to be the first shutdown of an educational institution in the province during the pandemic .
Michelle Toledano, executive director of the private school in Snowdon, sent parents a letter by email Wednesday night advising them of the decision to close the school. She informed them that students will continue with online learning until they return to class — not on Oct. 1, after what would have been the end of a 14-day quarantine, but on Oct. 5 because of the Jewish holiday of Sukkot.
Initially, public health investigators blamed the source of transmission on a Sept. 6 bar mitzvah attended by many students of Herzliah. However, the school also decided to probe the possibility of a COVID-19 outbreak within the walls of the institution itself.
The Mountain Sights Ave. school discovered Sept. 8 that a student tested positive for the coronavirus. Three days later, public health officials held a screening clinic at the school and determined that a total of eight students were infected in class 1C, along with one case each in classes 2C, 2E and 4C. One employee also tested positive.
On Wednesday, the school learned that another student tested positive in a fifth class, homeroom 2D.
“Following the announcement of a new case, we informed public health immediately and, late that evening, we received confirmation of their instructions,” Toledano wrote to parents. “We apologize for this late notification.
“In response to the situation at school and in order to limit the spread of the virus within our school community, public health has just authorized us to continue online learning — and to temporarily suspend in-person classes — for all our high-school classes for a period of two weeks.”
Dr. Mylène Drouin, director of the Montreal public health department, confirmed the outbreak at Herzliah on Thursday morning as she gave an update on the latest epidemiological situation in the city. In addition to authorities posting 73 new COVID-19 cases in Montreal, they added a backlog of 222 from previous days.
“You have to understand that the outbreaks we have now in the school milieu are small ones, with the exception of this school, which had a bigger outbreak,” Drouin said.
“It’s often outbreaks of a few cases that are limited to a group or to a class of children. Clearly, the school milieu is safe for your children.”
In contrast, Drouin added, the situation at Herzliah is “more complex.”
“The principal source of these cases was in the community, the acquisition of the virus was in the community. We had a first outbreak of eight students in a class of 15, and then after that we had sporadic cases at different levels. Therefore, we had several classes that had to be isolated.
“In the context of the Jewish (high) holidays that are starting, and obviously the increase in the rate of incidence in this neighbourhood … we looked at different elements” that resulted in the decision to move to online learning for the whole school, Drouin explained.
In her remarks, Drouin mentioned there were more than 15 COVID-19 cases at Herzliah. The emails the school sent to parents suggested a total of 13 positive cases.
The public health department is holding discussions with Jewish community leaders to urge them to reinforce the importance of physical distancing and wearing masks during what are known as the High Holidays, starting with Rosh Hashanah (the Jewish New Year, which begins at sundown on Friday).
“We’re currently talking to leaders of the Jewish community who are going to celebrate for the three weeks of their holidays,” Drouin told reporters.
“Of course, we want to make sure that the number of people in those gatherings be minimized or reduced. We want to make sure that if they have celebrations, they keep the two-metre distancing, or if they can, do it outside.”
Public health is also recommending that the elderly and those who have weakened immune systems avoid such gatherings.
Meanwhile in Quebec City, at least 305 students and staff at the Sans-Frontière de Québec school were being screened for exposure to the coronavirus on Thursday, the local health authority disclosed in a statement. For now, officials have ruled out closing the school.
Across Quebec, at least 357 students and 96 school employees have tested positive, while 173 classes have been shuttered temporarily as of Sept. 16, the education ministry reported on Wednesday.
In Montreal, there have been at least seven school outbreaks, Drouin said earlier in the week.
As of Thursday afternoon, a total of 299 schools have been identified in the province where at least one student or employee has screened positive, according to covidecolesquebec.org , a website run by Nuns’ Island parent Olivier Drouin .
With eight regions — including Montreal — now coded yellow under the government’s pandemic warning system, Education Minister Jean-François Roberge went into detail for the first time Thursday about what would happen to schools in the event a region moves to higher alert levels. Some schools could close temporarily if a region rises to red, the highest alert, he said.
Should a region go from yellow to orange, students would resume sticking together in their class bubbles, eliminating the possibility of mixing with others during extracurricular activities, the minister told Presse Canadienne.

The outbreak of positive cases was first reported by the Boston Globe's Bob Hohler, whose source told him that the number of cases were thirteen. BC Bulletin reached out to Boston College for confirmation on that number, but the school could not confirm.
However, senior associate athletics director for communications Jason Baum released the following statement:
""We can confirm that members of our swimming and diving team have tested positive for COVID-19. “We have temporarily paused all team activities with the swimming and diving program. The student-athletes who tested positive are in isolation in accordance with university COVID-19 protocols.”
The school have been using selected off campus housing as isolation areas for student's who test positive.
This news comes shortly after students returned on campus to start the fall semester. It also comes on the heels of the football team having yet another round of COVID-19 testing without a positive. Per the last statement from the school, the football team and their staff have had over 1700 tests done, with only one positive. That student who tested positive has made a full recovery and has rejoined the team.
While last week the men's soccer team cancelled their fall season, due to the team struggling to get players back on campus due to travel restrictions caused by the pandemic.

Of the deaths, five were identified during a delayed records review, according to the state.
The additions bring the state's total number of cases to 114,692 and the death toll to 6,632.
With probable cases included, Michigan has had 125,742 cases and 6,943 deaths, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.
Michigan reached its highest daily count since April 24 on Friday with 1,313 cases and nine deaths from COVID-19.
In the past seven days, the state added 6,097 cases and80 deaths.
The weekly number of new cases reported peaked April 5-11 at 9,768.
Over the first 11 days of September, the state has confirmed more 17% more cases than it did over the first 11 days of August.
While there are signs the number of new COVID-19 cases is inching upward in Michigan, according to the state's data, state health officials say Friday's single-day spike in cases does not necessarily represent a trend.
""It takes a while to analyze the referrals, to collect information on critical factors like onset date that really best describe the status,"" said Bob Wheaton, spokesman for the MDHHS.
""We have seen an increase in testing, which is good, and that could contribute. We will continue to closely monitor the data as we always do and look for trends based on data for a week or longer.""
Of those infected, the statewide fatality rate has dropped from 9.5% in June to 5.8% as of Thursday.
In Detroit, there are a total of 14,153 cases and 1,519 fatalities.

As of Wednesday, 548 Michigan residents were hospital inpatients with the virus, and 65 were on ventilators and 145 in intensive care units.
Of the 52 outbreaks in the last two weeks, nine have been at colleges, five have been at retail outlets and six at agriculture/food processing sites. Additionally, social gatherings including birthday parties, graduations, funerals and weddings have contributed to seven outbreaks, according to the state.
In long-term care facilities, 8,346 residents and 4,587 staff members have confirmed cases. More than 6,381 are recovering. Since March, 2,124 residents and 21 staff members have died from the virus.
The state recorded five new outbreaks in K-12 schools as of Sept. 10. Data also show that seven new outbreaks have come from social gatherings and nine from colleges and universities in the state.
On Saturday, Michigan State University reported 342 cases of coronavirus linked to the school and urged students to quarantine and avoid gatherings. Ingham County now has 2,525 cases of COVID-19 and has asked people in several large properties to quarantine as well.

A discipline that boasts only 30 practising specialists in the city, and traditionally attracts the academically brightest, Tam said his education gave him a sense of duty to join the ""dirty team"", and work in Covid-19 isolation wards when the virus hit the city at the start of the year.
""The responsibility has fallen onto me. I had to do it,"" the 30-year-old said. ""I know more about infectious diseases than some others. If I don't set a good example, it'd be hard to persuade other colleagues to do it.

""But it was daunting, the virus has only just emerged in the world. We didn't know how infectious or deadly it could be.""
His first patients were a pair of tourists from mainland China who were among the first in the world to be diagnosed with Covid-19.
""They couldn't quite believe they had the disease,"" he said. ""It took quite a while to explain to them they were confirmed.""
For the resident at Queen Mary Hospital's department of medicine, bigger challenges arrived in the form of the city's third wave, when infections spiked and rose to as many as 149 a day.
With the city's total number of confirmed cases now beyond 4,900, and more than 100 deaths, the virus had stretched hospital capacity to the limit, Tam said.
One particularly tricky patient had lymphoma and could not be treated with interferon, a powerful antiviral drug used against the coronavirus, because of his pre-existing condition. Remedisvir, another antiviral medication, had ""almost no effect"" on him.
But after two therapies using convalescent plasma rich in antibodies, which was donated by recovered Covid-19 patients, the man eventually made a full recovery.
""There was a moment we thought we could lose him. It was quite a miracle,"" said Ivan Hung Fan-ngai, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of Hong Kong (HKU), and Tam's mentor.
Things were very different six years ago when Tam began his specialist training. Having entered HKU's medical school in 2008, it was Ebola that was making the news in 2014, and his family was against him pursuing the discipline, worried he might become infected.
Tam said the satisfaction of being able to cure a patient was what had drawn him to the subject in the first place, that and the detective work hunting down a particular disease could involve.
""Unlike diabetes or high blood pressure which are difficult to completely get rid of, you can snuff out an infection so that your patient does not have to keep coming back for appointments,"" he said.
Over the past nine months, Hung and Tam have been involved in looking after Covid-19 patients at Queen Mary Hospital, as well as researching transmission of the disease on the Diamond Princess cruise liner, and more recently, confirming the first case of Covid-19 reinfection.
Like Tam, Hung left medical school and immediately found himself in a world gripped by a virus outbreak, the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2003.
It was there he would earn his stripes and eventually go on to become an infectious disease expert, much like his mentor, Professor Yuen Kwok-yung, who is advising the government on the coronavirus.
Ultimately, Tam wants to follow in their footsteps, but for now he is focused on fighting Covid-19 and preparing for a potential fourth wave that could hit the city in the next few months.

Temple put a two-week “pause” on in-person classes after the university identified more than 100 positive Covid-19 cases over the weekend. Farley said during a press conference Tuesday that there is a “substantial risk” of the outbreak infecting communities surrounding Temple because many students live off-campus in neighborhoods.
Farley urged Temple students to stay in their dorms or apartments unless they are running essential errands and to avoid social gatherings. Contact tracing found that many of the students that tested positive live in apartments off-campus with multiple people or attended small social gatherings, he said.
“You should assume that everyone around you is infected,” he said.
The Department of Public Health on Sunday sent a team to a residential building off campus where three students had tested positive. The department tested 38 people and 15 of those people tested positive for Covid-19, Farley said. Results of other tests conducted on campus by the Department of Public Health and Temple University have not yet come in, he added. The two entities are working together to contain the virus and to devise a longer-term plan, he said.
Temple was one of several local universities that opted to have hybrid in-person and online instruction for the fall semester. Other colleges, such as Drexel University and the University of Pennsylvania, opted for online-only semesters, making Temple the largest Philadelphia-area school to start the fall semester on campus. Dozens of universities across the United States that opened campuses saw case numbers spike, and many chose to shut down campuses and move to remote instruction.
Covid-19 cases in Philadelphia have been declining in recent weeks, hovering between 80 and 100 positive test results per day. For the week ending Aug. 29, Philadelphia had 97 cases per day on average, with an average 3.7% positive rate. In the last two days, 32% of positive cases were reported from people between the ages of 20 and 29, likely from college-aged people, Farley said.
The city has had 33,909 positive cases since the beginning of the pandemic, with 1,751 total deaths."

The number of infected inmates and staff – 68 as of Wednesday afternoon – makes it one of the largest single-facility outbreaks Maine has seen during the pandemic.
Another active outbreak, at Maplecrest Rehabilitation and Living Center in Madison, increased Wednesday to 13 cases comprising seven residents and six staff members.
Both are connected to an Aug. 7 wedding in Millinocket that so far has been linked to 143 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
A third active outbreak, at the Calvary Baptist Church in Sanford, is being investigated as possibly connected. The pastor of that church, Todd Bell, officiated the wedding. So far, five cases have been traced to the church.
In all, state health officials reported 26 new cases of COVID-19 and one death on Wednesday, when Gov. Janet Mills extended the state of civil emergency another 30 days, through Oct. 1.

The death, a man in his 70s from Somerset County, was the first fatality reported in seven days.
Maine has now tracked 4,567 confirmed and probable cases since mid-March, along with 133 COVID-19 related deaths.
The outbreak at the York County Jail includes 46 inmates, 19 corrections officers and three other building employees, Sheriff William King said in an email Wednesday. The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday that 17 people who live in staff members’ households also have tested positive.
Widespread testing has been underway for several days at the jail. Given the vulnerability of the population, there is concern the number of cases could increase. The jail has been testing every inmate upon arrival for some time, but it’s not clear how often staff members are tested. The Maine CDC has said that a staff member attended the wedding in Millinocket.
King did not respond to multiple requests for an interview Wednesday and canceled a planned Zoom call with members of the media.
Last week, the sheriff had said the outbreak is “raising havoc with our staffing issues.” The 19 corrections officers who have tested positive represent roughly half of King’s staff of 40 at a jail that is budgeted to have 75 officers.
Inmates and guards have been required to wear masks since the first positive test result came back last month. Previously, the jail required guards to wear masks only when working with an inmate who was suspected of having the virus. At other times, the decision to wear a mask had been up to the individual inmates and guards, King said.
Public health officials have said that face coverings can significantly reduce the transmission of COVID-19.

Maine’s biggest outbreaks have been at Cape Memory Care (85 cases), the Springbrook Center (78 cases) the Augusta Center for Health and Rehabilitation (77) and Falmouth By the Sea (75 cases). Those numbers reflect staff and residents only, and not household members, the CDC says. While those outbreaks are all considered closed, the number of cases at the jail could continue to grow.
Maine CDC spokesman Robert Long cautioned against comparing outbreaks and said the other large outbreaks were in long-term care facilities, which pose different infection control challenges.
The York County Jail outbreak is by far Maine’s largest at a correctional facility.
There was a small outbreak of three cases at the Cumberland County Jail in July, although two of those inmates ended up being negative on retests. Four inmates at the Maine Correctional Center in Windham tested positive for COVID-19 in May.
Outside of Maine, some of the country’s largest COVID-19 clusters this summer involved outbreaks at prisons and jails. Research also shows that outbreaks in correctional facilities often spill into the surrounding community.
Maine’s seven-day average of 25.7 cases on Wednesday was up from the seven-day average one week ago, 22.9 cases on Aug. 26. The rate has been steadily increasing since a low of 14 cases in early August but is still well below the peak of more than 50 daily cases Maine experienced in late May. The state’s infection and death rates remain among the lowest in the country, which has now eclipsed 6 million cases and 184,000 deaths.
Hospitalizations remain low as well, just 11 on Wednesday, including six people in critical care. Since the pandemic hit Maine, 423 people have been hospitalized at some point.
The number of active cases decreased from 471 to 456 on Wednesday.
In extending the state of civil emergency, Mills said the outbreaks illustrate how quickly the coronavirus can spread if people don’t adhere to safety guidelines.
“Thanks to the efforts of Maine people, who have largely abided by public health measures intended to keep us all safe, our state has been relatively successful in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 in the last few months,” the governor said in a statement. “The outbreaks which we hear about in other states every day can sometimes feel far away from the relative safety of our state, but recent events prove that one little match can spark a fire that may be very difficult to put out.
“Pandemic fatigue is setting in, but we cannot let down our guard, especially as some of our schools and universities bring students back on campus and back into the classroom.”
Nearly every other state has ongoing emergency declarations, which allow them to draw certain federal resources
In addition to tracking cases linked to the Millinocket wedding, the state is closely watching schools, some of which have started reopening.
The University of Maine System reported two additional COVID-19 cases at the Orono campus on Wednesday, but also released two students from isolation. The total number of active cases remain at 13 systemwide: 10 in Orono, two at the University of Southern Maine and one at the University of Maine at Farmington. The system has conducted more than 7,500 tests of asymptomatic students so far.
On Wednesday, the Maine Principals’ Association once again delayed the start of the fall high school sports season – by one week – as it works with state agencies to develop appropriate COVID-19 safety guidelines.
Meanwhile, the Maine CDC has launched separate investigations into clusters of cases among students at the University of New England and Maine Maritime Academy. Each school reported three additional COVID-19 cases among students.
The University of Maine System, as of Tuesday, reported 13 cases among students or staff at the various campuses. Six of those cases – including two new cases in Orono – were identified through the more than 6,600 “asymptomatic arrival screening” tests conducted to date on the various campuses.
As the state works to keep outbreaks from spreading, more people are using the CDC’s online contact tracing program, Sara Alert. As of last week, 386 people were being actively monitored and 4,185 people had enrolled since it launched in May.
The state has conducted more than 275,000 COVID-19 tests so far and approximately 2 percent have come back positive. However, as testing capacity has increased, that positivity rate has decreased considerably. Over the last week, the rate is 0.6 percent.

A group of experts outlined several criteria that could be used to decide if a COVID-19 vaccine is mandatory for children.
Several COVID-19 vaccines are in late-stage clinical trials, but so far none have been approved in the United States for widespread public use or even emergency use.
Experts say mandating a vaccine early on could backfire.
All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub and follow our live updates page for the most recent information on the COVID-19 outbreak.
As the search continues for a safe and effective vaccine against the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, that causes COVID-19, 3 experts have weighed in on a question that has been on many parents’ minds: Will schools make any future vaccine mandatory for children?
Several COVID-19 vaccines are in late-stage clinical trials, but so far none have been approved in the United States for widespread public use or even emergency use.
But conversations have already emerged about how to ensure widespread adoption of a vaccine.
“An obvious group to target for mandatory vaccination is children,” write the authors of a viewpoint article published Sept. 14 in the journal JAMA Pediatrics. “Not only do we already mandate several vaccines for them to attend school, but strategies to reopen schools or keep them open may be predicated on it.”
Recommendations for which vaccines children and teens should receive come from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).
But there’s no national mandate for which vaccinations children need in order to attend school. Instead, these decisions fall to the states, including when parents can request an exemption from vaccination for their child.
Johan C. Bester, PhD, director of bioethics and an assistant professor of family medicine at the University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV) School of Medicine, said most of the mandatory vaccines on the CDC’s and AAP’s vaccine schedules serve a dual purpose.
“They protect the individual child, and they also create this herd immunity effect so that the disease does not spread,” said Bester, who wasn’t one of the authors of the paper. “Therefore, it is best for children who can be vaccinated [with these] to be vaccinated.”
The viewpoint authors outlined 9 criteria that would be used to decide whether a COVID-19 vaccine should be mandatory for children.
While all these criteria are important, the authors prioritized 5 of them, with vaccine safety at the top of the list.
“This is a very new vaccine, so we really want to scrutinize the data carefully to make sure that it is safe,” Bester said.
Safety data will come from large-scale, phase 3 clinical trials and ongoing monitoring that occurs after a vaccine is made available to the public.
So far none of these phase 3 trials include children, something that Dr. Walter Orenstein, associate director of the Emory Vaccine Center and a professor of infectious diseases at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia, has been pushing for.
“The sooner we get children involved in the trials the better,” he said.
At the very least, he said vaccine makers should do small-scale, phase 1 and 2 trials in children, which look at safety and whether the vaccine generates an immune response. Then, if needed, larger trials with children can be run.
Orenstein wasn’t an author on the viewpoint article, but he co-authored an article in June in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases calling for children to be included in COVID-19 vaccine trials.
The other 4 top criteria in the viewpoint article include:
The disease causes substantial illness and death in part of the population. The United States has already seen more than 195,000 COVID-19 deaths, with older people and those with underlying health conditions affected most.
Vaccinating children should reduce the spread of the virus. “Older children clearly participate in transmission,” Orenstein said. But data for younger children is mixed, with some studies showing that they transmit the virus, but others suggesting they’re not major contributors to its spread.
A COVID-19 vaccine should protect children from the disease. The authors write that a vaccine doesn’t need to be 100-percent effective, but its effectiveness should be comparable to other mandatory vaccines. This won’t be known until the phase 1 trials are completed.
Vaccination shouldn’t be a burden for the child or the parents or guardian. This means the vaccine should be widely available, easily accessible, and affordable.
The other criteria include that vaccination makes children safer at school, the vaccine can be delivered easily, the vaccine is accepted by the public and medical community, and the vaccine is cost effective.
Bester said a COVID-19 vaccine will likely benefit children, because some of them can develop severe illness, including a condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome.
“COVID-19 is less dangerous in children than in adults and older people,” he said. “But there’s still some potential for disease in children.”
A safe and effective vaccine would also make it easier for children to resume activities that support their health and development — such as going to school, playing with friends, and visiting museums.
“That would allow us to return to some semblance of normality,” said Bester, “which would have obvious well-being benefits for children and for larger society.”
We’ll email you the latest developments about the novel coronavirus and Healthline's top health news stories, daily.
While children already need to have several vaccines before they enroll in school, Orenstein thinks making a COVID-19 vaccine mandatory for children is not a good way to go — at least at the beginning.
He points to the negative public response to Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s 2007 executive order requiring that all 11- and 12-year-old girls in the state get the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, which protects women against a sexually transmitted infection that causes cervical cancer.
Orenstein noted that the measles vaccine was voluntary at first. When that didn’t work, mandatory vaccination was instituted to pick up enough of the “stragglers” to protect the community.
“If there is general public support for a given vaccine,” Orenstein said, “you just want to reach immunity levels in your population that will prevent outbreaks.”
A mandatory COVID-19 vaccine isn’t the only way to encourage parents to have their children vaccinated.
Bester said pediatricians and other healthcare providers can play an important role in educating parents about the vaccine and allaying their concerns.
“While people might not trust governments and politicians so much when it comes to communication about the adverse effects and benefits of vaccines, they do often trust their doctors,” he said.
“When we roll out the vaccine,” Bester added, “it is important that there is some transparency with data, to the point where doctors and patients can have the kinds of conversations about safety that will be needed.”"

It’s in the poop.
The University of Arizona is studying the feces in its sewer system to test for COVID-19, and it might have already stopped a possible outbreak.
Researchers found in May that studying human feces in sewer systems worldwide could be the secret to curbing a second wave of COVID-19 until widespread testing is available.
The university is preparing for a variety of periodic tests to help curb the coronavirus — including one that involves screening raw sewage from the dorms to see if it is found in students’ poop.
School officials told The Washington Post that the technique has already been in use during move-in week for its 5,000 students and it might have already stopped a big outbreak on the campus after a sewage sample came back positive from one dorm. All students were quickly tested individually and two asymptomatic students tested positive and were quickly quarantined.
“With this early detection, we jumped on it right away, tested those youngsters, and got them the appropriate isolation where they needed to be,” said Richard Carmona, a former US surgeon general who is directing the school’s reentry task force, according to the paper.
Carmona lauded the university’s system.
“You think about if we had missed it, if we had waited until they became symptomatic and they stayed in that dorm for days or a week, or the whole incubation period, how many other people would have been infected?” he said.
“I really do think [the University of Arizona is] a good demonstration of the technique and technology because all the researchers working in this space internationally have come to the conclusion that is a very good early warning system,” Kevin Thomas, director of the University of Queensland’s Alliance for Environmental Health Sciences told The Washington Post.
Since the outbreak, it has been found that COVID-19 can be spread through “aerosolized feces,” and farts, and has the ability to waft through toilets into other apartments."

By Jane Johnston, Circle of Blue
The U.S. prison system has emerged as a center of Covid-19 transmission. Along with other national virus hot spots — meatpacking facilities, farmworker housing, and nursing homes — the outbreaks in jails and detention centers highlight a constellation of disease risks for people on the margins of American society.
“The pandemic has driven home the lessons that how these facilities are designed really matters,” Michele Deitch, a distinguished senior lecturer at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, told Circle of Blue. “The fact that people can’t physically separate from each other, the fact that they are so densely populated, the fact that people in custody don’t have ready access to hygiene supplies and a supply of water, all of those are things that have contributed to the high, high spread of the disease, the massive spread of disease, and the high numbers of deaths.”
As of August 18, according to data collected by the Marshall Project, over 102,000 cases have been confirmed among U.S. prisoners, and just over 22,000 cases among prison staff.
Aside from being densely populated and housing a high number of at-risk people, such as the elderly or those with chronic illnesses, prisons are generally unsanitary. Deitch said that prisoners often lack hygiene necessities like soap or hand sanitizer. Some don’t even have consistent access to running water.
“All the recommendations that the experts are telling us on the outside that we need to take are measures that really are not available to people inside,” said Deitch, who has spent her career trying to improve conditions for prisoners.
There are many reasons for the spread of Covid-19 in prisons, Deitch explained. Policy decisions, like not releasing medically vulnerable people or transferring people between facilities, contribute to crowding and disease spread. So does the failure to take basic precautions, such as not wearing masks or not quarantining prisoners with confirmed or suspected cases. A federal judge ordered California prison officials in July to dedicate space in each state jail for quarantine.
Keri Blakinger, who covers the U.S. criminal justice system as an investigative reporter for the Marshall Project, knows the difficulty of attributing an illness acquired in prison to a specific cause. With so many risk factors, it’s hard to draw a direct line between lack of water access and the spread of the virus.
“If there’s any kind of disease outbreak, it’s really easy to point to all these other factors that can contribute,” Blakinger told Circle of Blue. But that doesn’t mean that it’s not important to be concerned about water access, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) in prisons, she added.
WASH services have long been a source of health trouble inside prisons, contributing to disease outbreaks. “We can just sort of look at these things and logically understand that they’re problematic,” Blakinger said. “But the nature of prisons makes it really hard to prove specific examples of causality.”
One of the reasons for this is that reports from prisoners of water outages, sewage backups, and other plumbing problems often contradict what administrators say. “It’s just really difficult to verify because they’re behind prison walls,” she said. “It’s really hard to get any kind of proof.”
Preparing for Simultaneous Hazards
Chronic problems like infrastructure maintenance in jails tend to be magnified in times of crisis. Hurricane Harvey, in 2017, flooded three state and three federal prisons in Beaumont, Texas. Drinking water was disrupted for days and some inmates complained of dehydration.
Melissa Surette (Savilonis), adjunct professor at Endicott College and emergency management professional who has spent ten years studying how U.S. prisons respond to disasters, says that such stories indicate a lack of emergency planning.
The vast majority of prisons are underprepared for hazards like natural disasters and disease outbreaks, she found. The reason? Correctional facilities are underfunded.
With consistent line-item funding, prisons could fix big issues like staff shortages, purchasing and upgrading equipment, and planning for disasters.
“These are challenges we see across the country with other types of facilities as well, not just prison systems, but it’s really critical that we focus our time and effort on funding prison systems so they can plan and prepare for disasters,” Surette said.
As the country enters peak hurricane season — the Gulf Coast now faces Hurricane Laura, a Category 4 storm — Surette said there are two types of disaster plans that prisons should have in place. One is an operational plan, or what they’ll do when the storm strikes. The other is a mitigation plan, which Surette said is critical for identifying risks and developing strategies to address them before the disaster occurs.
Risks could include being located in a flood-prone area or one that is exposed to extreme wind or storm events.
Still, those plans mean nothing if a prison doesn’t have the resources or staff to support them.
“So you can have a wonderful plan that details how you’re going to respond and recover from an incident,” Surette said. “But if you don’t have the staff that know what’s in the plan, or what to do, or they if they don’t have access to it, and then if they don’t have the resources to support that plan, that presents a lot of challenges, and you kind of have this cascading effect.”
Blakinger said the real problem isn’t a lack of staff. It’s that there are too many prisoners. About 1.5 million people in the U.S. are incarcerated, meaning for every 100,000 Americans, 431 are imprisoned.
“I think that these sort of really basic maintenance problems are going to exist as long as we are trying to incarcerate this many people,” she said. “Mass incarceration is expensive and we don’t have money for the upkeep and that shows when it comes to these plumbing issues.”
The pandemic could be the nudge that catalyzes difficult debates. Sick prisoners have highlighted the need to re-examine not just operating procedures, but basic assumptions about the U.S. criminal justice system, whether it means providing more funding or locking up fewer people.
“We shouldn’t just be Covid-focused,” Surette said. “We should be thinking about this from a holistic perspective.”

Ninety-four students and four staff members at the University of South Dakota have reportedly tested positive for the novel coronavirus, according to data the school released Wednesday. Another 406 people who may have been exposed to the virus are in quarantine.
Dordt University reported that nine early-arrival students had tested positive for the virus. The students are in isolation away from the campus in Sioux Center, Iowa.
Just down the road in Orange City, eight students and two employees at Northwestern College have tested positive since Aug. 17, a spokesman said Wednesday.
A student at Buena Vista University tested positive for the virus last weekend, a spokeswoman said Wednesday. The student is isolated at home. Individuals who were in close contact with this student were notified and asked to quarantine and monitor for symptoms.
Officials at Briar Cliff University last week confirmed a student had tested positive and was quarantined. A Briar Cliff spokeswoman on Wednesday said the university has no updates on cases there. The Sioux City school started its fall classes this week."

Hospitalizations related to COVID-19 have declined in Nashville and on a statewide level but that trend is beginning to reverse in some regions of the state, according to a new report released by the Department of Health Policy in the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.
Large metro areas such as Nashville, Memphis and Chattanooga have seen fewer hospitalizations since late July, when outbreaks began to stretch outward into bordering counties. These outbreaks are taking place in the Upper Cumberland and parts of West and East Tennessee and the number of hospitalized cases in those regions has started to climb over the last week.
“Tennessee reached a high-water mark around 1,100 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in late July, and by late August those numbers had declined to under 900,” said John Graves, associate professor of health policy and director of the Center for Health Economic Modeling at Vanderbilt. “The overall situation is stable at around 900 patients. But this overall stability masks progress in some areas, and a recent reversal of trends in others. Our aim with this analysis was to both highlight the positive news and to underscore the importance of continued diligence.”
Graves says there aren't obvious factors that would let his team attribute the rising number of hospitalizations to schools reopening or county-specific policies such as mask mandates. In the areas with recent upticks, data shows elderly people are becoming infected more frequently than in earlier stages of the pandemic, according to Graves.
Although it is too soon to tell what impact reopening schools will have on the outbreak, Meharry Medical College President and infectious disease expert James Hildreth told the Post in August the increase in transmission will be seen on a regional basis. Counties without mitigation efforts — i.e. the use of facial coverings, alternative learning strategies in schools — face the risk of clustering that can turn into widespread outbreaks in a relatively short amount of time.
Hospital bed and medical device availability continue to fluctuate across the state. Nearly 17 percent (1,985) of all floor beds and 15 percent (307) of ICU beds in Tennessee are available. Statewide numbers do not tell the whole story, though. Most infectious disease experts — and the data — look at outbreaks of COVID-19 by region due to the state’s county-level approach to mitigating the epidemic.
While the number of active cases in Nashville has fallen by nearly 1,400 in the past two weeks, counties in the regions described above — namely Carroll, Carter, Cumberland, Fentress, Gibson, Greene, Hardin, McMinn, Monroe, Sullivan and Wayne — have all seen increases of more than 50 active cases over the past two weeks. That shows the virus is continuing to spread in the state’s more rural, less populated counties.
According to the Sycamore Institute’s Health Care Capacity Dashboard, the average number of residents per staffed inpatient bed across the state is 421 per bed. Most of the counties now seeing more cases and hospitalizations have fewer beds than the average. While the state does not provide capacity reports for individual hospitals, the Department of Health has confirmed no regional systems have yet been overwhelmed due to COVID hospitalizations. The majority, if not all, of the state's hospitals have reopened elective surgeries.
The rising spread among older residents in some rural areas likely is spurring the increase in hospitalizations since people with pre-existing medical conditions and an overall weaker immune system are more susceptible to developing severe symptoms. The typical length of hospitalization among survivors of COVID is 10 to 13 days. Medicaid data shows nearly 35 percent of its enrollees are staying longer than that.
Overall, the outbreak appears to be stabilizing in most of the state. But upticks in transmission within one county can quickly spread to another and set off a chain reaction that fills hospital beds in areas that aren’t as developed to withstand high volumes of patients.
“What our analysis does makes clear is that as we approach the fall, we’re not close to being out of the woods,” Graves wrote in the report. ""We have to keep our focus on taking care of ourselves and our neighbors. Our primary goals need to be focused on keeping the state safely open for education, health care, and businesses."""

Alisha Morris, a theater teacher in Olathe, Kansas, wanted to know how many coronavirus cases were being reported in schools, but as she scoured the internet, she couldn’t find the information all in one spot. So she started keeping track herself.
Now, her database is available on a website hosted by the National Education Association. You can search by state to find a list of confirmed COVID-19 cases at public K-12 schools across the US. The tracker provides the number of known cases and deaths for students, teachers, and administrators, as well as a link to a news story where the information originated.
Morris began keeping tabs of the confirmed cases she stumbled across online on August 6. ""I put in the words 'school, positive,'"" she told NPR's Morning Edition. ""I clicked on the news tab and would search the articles from the past week or the past 24 hours and then I would input those articles into my spreadsheet.""
After she made her database public, teachers began sharing it, and she started receiving personal anecdotes about cases that hadn't been covered by the news.
“Based on the anecdotes that people have sent me, there have been tons of schools that have been purposely trying to keep this on the down low,” Morris told NPR. “They will tell the close contacts and maybe the staff, but then they won't publicize it any further than that. So a lot of the submissions I received were screenshots of staff emails or parent emails telling about the case. But then when I went to go find an article about it, there wasn't anything about it.”
At first, she wasn’t sure if she should include those cases in her spreadsheet, because they weren’t verified by a news organization. But in the end, she decided to add a section for “possible” outbreaks. That section is included on the NEA spreadsheets, and there’s a link to report COVID-19 cases, although you must have a verifying source. “Examples of verifying sources include news articles and district websites/press releases,” the site states. “Only publicly verifiable information is published in our public reports.”
She handed the project over on August 23 to the NEA, where a team will keep the information up to date. By then, she and volunteers working with her had recorded nearly 4,300 cases at more than 1,000 schools. Florida schools had the most cases, followed by Texas and Georgia.
This isn’t the first time a private citizen has started a COVID-19 data collection because no publicly available official information exists: Brown University economist Emily Oster started maintaining a tally on COVID-19 cases at day cares and camps after she couldn’t find national numbers online. “I held off doing this data collection for a long time thinking, surely, someone else will start doing this and do it better,” she told Working Mother in July. “And then they didn’t, and didn’t, and didn’t, and I finally pulled the trigger. But it’s really frustrating that this is how we got to this. It seems like most places are planning to open schools, and yet they really haven’t collected the data that would help them do it safely.”
Now, thanks to the efforts of Morris and Oster, we have a clearer picture of where outbreaks are happening and how much they’re impacting kids and staff—information parents desperately need to make fully informed decisions about how to handle work and childcare this fall."

In a message sent to students and staff on Thursday, university president Richard Englert said most classes — an estimated 95% — will be conducted online instead.
Some essential in-person teaching will continue, including classes that are part of the school’s physical therapy and nursing programs.
“We will continue to work together as a community to ensure that students receive the quality education they expect from Temple and continue progress toward their degree,” said Englert.
Students living in university housing can opt to return home to complete their courses, according to the announcement. If they leave by Sept.13., the school will fully refund their room and board for the fall semester.
Students who “want or need to remain on campus” can stay.
“Those students are welcome to remain, and we will make available the academic and other support services and activities that you need to succeed, including Temple’s high-quality health services,” said Englert.
On Sunday, the university announced that classes would be held online for two weeks.
But as of Wednesday, the university reported 212 active cases of COVID-19. All but one was designated as “on-campus.”
Between Friday and Sunday, active cases rose from 50 to 100. Between Sunday and Wednesday, that total eclipsed 200."

Officials issued a safety alert on Sunday calling for mandatory testing and quarantine of all 287 students living in Rich, Jones, Morgan and Davis on-campus residence halls.
Classes started Monday at the school and some of the students had just moved into their rooms.
The mandatory quarantine is effective immediately and will continue until the test results are returned. USU also activated a Covid care team to arrange for resources to assist the affected students, including meal deliveries.

""The benefit of testing the water is that we get a snapshot into what is happening on campus and can quarantine even before a student becomes symptomatic. It is also less invasive,"" DeRito said.
No other testing samples on campus taken this week show elevated levels of the virus and there are currently no reported positive tests for Covid-19 in the quarantined residence halls, according to a university press release.
In mid-August, the CDC announced creation of the National Wastewater Surveillance System to help local public health leaders better understand the extent of the spread of the pandemic in their communities.
Sewage from house and workplaces can be tested for genetic material from the novel coronavirus. Studies show the virus can be found in feces from people who are sick and also from people who don't yet have Covid-19 symptoms.
Testing for all Americans a 'utopian' idea, administration official says
Adm. Brett Giroir, the Trump administration's coronavirus testing czar, on Tuesday dismissed the idea of daily Covid-19 tests for all Americans as ""utopian.""
""It's great to talk about this utopian kind of idea where everybody has a test every day and we can do that,"" Giroir said. ""I don't live in a utopian world. I live in the real world, and the real world had no tests for this new disease when this first started.""
The assistant secretary for health at the US Department of Health and Human Services said that the country now has a ""huge diversity"" of tests, including a $5 point of care test that provides results within 15 minutes.
""There is no stone unturned, there is no technology that we're not looking at or investing in if it's promising,"" Giroir said. ""We can return to society without having everyone have a test every single day. We can do that. We're showing we can do that.
""There may be a time where everybody can wake up in the morning, pass through a tricorder and tell whether they're infected or not,"" Giroir said, referring to the fictional handheld device from ""Star Trek"" that could scan people for data. ""We are not there yet.""
Testing availability and speed has improved in the US, particularly since the disastrous spring delays. Giroir said 91.9% of results from major referral labs, which do about half the tests in the US, were completed in three days. The mean turnaround time in August for large referral labs was 2.27 days.
Still, that 2.27-day average delay allows the virus to quietly spread, and public health and lab industry experts have repeatedly called on the federal government to take a larger leadership role in coordinating testing supplies.
US Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, the House majority whip, responded to Giroir's comments by saying, ""It would not be utopian if we had a national program to combat this pandemic. It may be going state by state. But one national program would not be utopian at all.""
CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen indicated that Giroir was attacking a straw man. Testing is an important part of public health strategy, but no one seriously argues testing can solve everything alone.
""He says, 'People say we can test our way out of the pandemic.' I have never heard anyone seriously say that,"" Cohen said. ""He needs to stop making up these boogie men who he's fighting against. No one is telling him we need a utopia. We're just telling him he needs to do better.""
Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, noted on Twitter that the White House staff has widespread testing, as do sports leagues such as the NFL.
""It's not utopia to want to test teachers & kids to return to school, nursing home residents to stay alive, first responders and other essential workers,"" he wrote. ""Sure, lets call it utopia when it's for the less privileged.""
Dire warnings for Iowa
A White House coronavirus task force report sent to officials in the state of Iowa this week warned of dire new case increases across rural and urban areas and called for a mask mandate, the closure of bars, and for university towns to do more as the pandemic intensifies in the Midwest.
CNN has obtained the nine-page August 30 report for the state, first reported by the Des Moines Register, from the Iowa Department of Public Health. The task force releases state-by-state reports each week to governors' offices, and has so far declined to make them publicly available.
The report says that Iowa is in the task force-defined ""red zone"" and warns that the state has the highest rate of cases in the US, which increased by 77.4% from the previous week.
Campus outbreaks
In the report, the task force points to universities as a major factor contributing to the virus's spread.
The three counties with the highest numbers of cases also have large student populations: Story County, home to Iowa State, and Johnson County, home to University of Iowa, as well as Polk County, which contains Iowa's largest metro area, Des Moines.
The university crossed the 1,000 active case mark on August 29 when it reported 302 cases in a single day. The overall current case load, including employees, is 1,026.
Other schools reported outbreaks.
At the University of South Carolina, 1,017 students currently have Covid-19, according to the university's coronavirus dashboard, making it one of the highest case counts recorded at a college so far.
Despite the climbing active case count and the fact that 60% of the university's designated quarantine space is in use, according to its dashboard, the school still lists its' alert level as ""low.""
The University of Missouri has 424 active student Covid-19 cases, according to the school's Covid-19 dashboard. James Madison University is reporting 138 new Covid-19 positive cases among its students and employees since Monday, according the JMU dashboard.
More than 20,000 cases of Covid-19 among students and staff have been reported at colleges and universities across at least 36 states, according to a CNN tally.
The campus reopenings represent new coronavirus hot spots in a country with plenty enough already as the US surpassed 6 million total confirmed cases on Monday.
NIH rejects plasma treatment
A National Institutes of Health panel said there's no evidence backing the use of convalescent plasma to treat coronavirus patients and that doctors should not treat it as a standard of care until more study has been done.
""There are insufficient data to recommend either for or against the use of convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19,"" the panel of more than three dozen experts said in a statement posted on the NIH website.
The statement, which was posted quietly, contradicts the Trump administration's characterization of the treatment as ""historic"" and a ""major advance"" and directly refers to last week's emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration.
Also Tuesday, an independent committee said any eventual coronavirus vaccine should go first to the people most at risk of catching it.
The draft report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine makes recommendations similar to those that have come from other groups, but it goes into detail to explain why health workers, for instance, should be among the first to get a vaccine."

Then they all got COVID-19.,"ROCKFORD, Ill. — On Aug. 20, two Rockford moms and their daughters didn’t really know anyone who had COVID-19.
Five days later, they would know dozens of people who had tested positive for the potentially fatal respiratory disease, including themselves.
Longtime friends Jessica Iasparro and Missy Minnaert and their daughters, Kate Sweeney and Gillian Sheley — all of Rockford — say the past two weeks have been filled with body aches, sore throats, shortness of breath, coughing, loss of taste and smell, debilitating headaches, extreme fatigue, isolation and quarantine.
And they count themselves lucky.
The four women — along with Minnaert’s husband, Jon, who also fell ill and tested positive for COVID-19 — unknowingly drove smack into the middle of what would become one of the largest outbreaks in the Midwest when they moved Sweeney and Sheley back to school at the University of Iowa.
Sweeney and Sheley are two of more than a thousand students who have tested positive for COVID-19 since students started returning to campus in mid-August.
Today, everyone is on the road to recovery. They’re still a little tired and worried about what the future holds, but they’re relieved that their brush with COVID-19 wasn’t any worse.
“Luckily, when I came back from taking Kate, three of my other kids were at their dad’s,” Iasparro said. “When Kate starting showing symptoms the next day, I quarantined and they just stayed with their dad.”
Then, after Iasparro fell ill, her husband tested negative, she said, and the couple’s two daughters, ages 3 and 5, have showed no symptoms.
The Minnaerts quarantined immediately after Sheley’s diagnosis, as well, and other family members have tested negative.
“This was solely from Jessica and I moving our daughters in. We didn’t go out to dinner. We did nothing else,” Minnaert said. “Kate tested positive on the 21st. Gillian tested positive on the 23rd, and then I started feeling sick on Sunday and tested positive on Tuesday. That’s how quick it was.”
Both families said they did everything they could to stay safe during their several hours in Iowa City on Aug. 20.

They wore masks and kept others at a distance as Iasparro moved Sweeny into her sorority and the Minnaerts moved Sheley into her apartment.
“Before we checked into the house, we had a survey we had to fill out. We had temperature checks. We wore masks,” Iasparro said. “Of course, everybody answered the survey ‘no, I don't have symptoms,’ and ‘no, I haven't knowingly been around anyone with COVID.’ At that point, no one had tested positive yet.”
When Iasparro and Sweeney were done moving Sweeney in, they went over to Sheley’s apartment to pitch in.
They had extended contact with only one other student, a friend of both daughters who tested positive the following day, the same day that Sweeney started feeling sick.
Sweeney, 20, was the first member of the two families to test positive.
She returned to campus on Aug. 15 and had been staying with friends as she helped her sorority prepare for the coming school year.
Sweeney said she and her friends were being careful. They didn’t go out. They didn’t go to crowded bars or restaurants or attend parties, although that kind of activity was going on all around them.
Sweeney said she stayed in a tightknit circle of friends and stayed home, but it didn’t matter. Everyone in the group tested positive for COVID-19 in a matter of days.
Sweeney ended up returning to Rockford to quarantine and recover with her mom and has since returned to Iowa City.
“I was really sick day one and then, day two and three, I just had really bad body aches,” Sweeney said. “On day four, I lost my sense of taste and smell — that was horrible. That lasted six days. … I’m still extremely short of breath.”
Sweeney is a junior studying health and human physiology. These days, her coursework is the least of her worries.
“They can send us home any minute and we just don’t know,” she said. “It's not even my classes giving me anxiety. It’s just a huge time of fear and uncertainty.
“I don't know whether I'm going to be here in a week or not. Every single day is something new. … I literally can't go anywhere. It’s just so different.”

Sheley was excited to be heading back to college, but she was a little nervous, too.
On the ride over, the 19-year-old asked her mom how long she thought it would take before she got COVID-19.
""I knew, going into school, that I was probably going to get it, just being around so many kids,"" Sheley said. ""My mom was, like, ‘Oh, I give it two weeks.’
""But it ended up being two days.""
The body aches and shortness of breath were among the worst symptoms for Sheley, who, like Sweeney, returned to Rockford and quarantined with her mom.
“I could barely walk up the stairs without being exhausted,” she said.
Sheley is back on campus now, too.
She said she cleaned her entire apartment before she left for quarantine and upon her return.
For now, she’s enrolled full time at an Iowa City community college, taking all online classes. She plans on re-enrolling in the University of Iowa in January.
Sheley said she plans on spending as much time as she can in her apartment this semester with a small group of friends.
“It's super frustrating, but there's a point where you can be mad about it or you can try to do whatever you can,” she said. “College isn't the same right now, but we definitely don't want to be back to where we were in the spring.”
The worst thing about her illness, Sheley said, was that her parents came down with it, too.
“I called my mom on Sunday and I heard it in her voice,” she said. “I was, like, ‘I’m so sorry.’ But she said, ‘Do not say sorry.’
“Everyone we were around that day, they were fine — they felt fine,” she said. “It wasn’t until the next day. It was like a train. They didn’t expect it.”
Iasparro, a health and physical education teacher at Rockford Lutheran School, already is back at work.
She worked the day after she went to Iowa, before her daughter called her and told her she had COVID-19, but no one at the school has had symptoms or tested positive for the virus.
Iasparro said she didn’t start to feel sick until she had been home for a couple of days.
“It was like I had a bad cold: I had a headache; I had body chills; my skin hurt to the touch,” she said. “My bones were really achy for about two days.”
Minnaert said the exhaustion was so extreme she doesn’t remember much from the first few days of her illness.
“The fatigue is profound,” she said. “Doing something like getting my laundry out and changing it over and bringing it upstairs, I’d need to sit down at the kitchen table and then I’d sleep for an hour and a half.”
There have been more than 6 million cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. so far this year and more than 190,000 deaths.

Iasparro and Minnaert said they count their blessings that no one was any sicker than they were, and no one required hospitalization.
“We really feel so lucky,” Minnaert said. “So many people have gotten it and had so many other things happen, like hospitalization and pneumonia and losing their lives.”

169,https://www.abc27.com/back-to-school/shelter-in-place-enacted-at-hood-college-after-confirmed-covid-19-case/,-0.918,Shelter-in-place enacted at Hood College after confirmed COVID-19 case,"FREDERICK, Md. (WDVM) — Hood College has enacted a shelter-in-place on campus after one person tested positive for COVID-19.
The order began Sunday night, and is expected to last 72 hours, unless it is further extended. Hood College says one person has tested positive, but 14 students were moved into quarantine, exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19. Those students are being tested but have not yet gotten results.
“Although we only have one confirmed case at this time, it is prudent to exercise extreme caution for the safety of our community and to allow us to better understand the extent to which the virus is present on campus,” said Laurie Ward, of Hood College.
A letter sent to the campus community says the shelter-in-lace will last until at least 7 a.m. Thursday, September 10. All classes will shift to virtual learning. In-person internships will be suspended for the next few days, at least. Faculty who need to get into offices, labs, or classrooms in order to teach will be allowed on campus. Otherwise, employees will work remotely unless they are essential personnel.
Hood College is asking students who live on campus to stay in their rooms as much as possible. They’re allowed to leave to use restrooms or pick up food. There will be no in-person dining on campus and off-campus food delivery will not be allowed.
Hood College says students should not leave campus unless they have off-campus jobs or other obligations that cannot be cancelled. Students with those circumstances have to tell their RA and will be required to get tested for COVID-19 on Tuesday.
Hood College President Dr. Andrea Chapdelaine concluded her note to the community by reminding students, if rules are not followed to stop the spread of COVID-19, campus will stay closed.

The Utah Department of Health confirmed Thursday that it began providing the tests this week “on a limited basis” in Utah County, which has seen the biggest jump in cases recently. And it plans to soon extend the offer statewide for all public K-12 faculty, said spokesperson Tom Hudachko, including custodians, bus drivers and others.
“The testing is voluntary and is designed to give teachers and staff peace of mind,” he added.
The tests are part of the state’s contract with TestUtah, Hudachko said, and it will be thoroughly monitored.
Every school district will be provided with a unique code. A teacher or staffer there who wants to get tested will be given that code and will enter it on TestUtah’s website to get an order for a test. It doesn’t matter if they have symptoms, which has been preferred in the state to qualify for a test. The faculty member will be able to go to any TestUtah location to get swabbed.
The code will tie the teachers to their school so the state can track outbreaks. The hope is to get a sense of how much the coronavirus is spreading in schools here, which have already seen 371 cases since they began reopening Aug. 13 at the encouragement of the governor.
But it comes, too, at the request of educators, said Dr. Angela Dunn, the state’s epidemiologist, during an interim legislative meeting of the education committee on Tuesday.
Many teachers across the state have been worried about taking the virus home to their families or getting sick themselves with returning to the classroom. Some fear because of age or health conditions that they’re more likely to get seriously ill from the coronavirus if students bring it to school. And most studies confirm that kids are often carriers of the disease.
“Our teachers are stressed out about whether they’re positive or not,” noted Sen. Kathleen Riebe, D-Cottonwood Heights, during the meeting, noting that many have not been allowed to work from home this fall.
Dunn said the testing is meant to provide them with an answer. And teachers will be able to test repeatedly throughout the year at no cost. She believes the program will be fully online by next week.
She also hopes it may also be able to reduce spread. If a teacher is worried about exposure but not symptomatic, for instance, and they test positive, then they can stay home earlier than they might if they waited for a cough or shortness of breath.
The state, overall, is also hoping to expand asymptomatic testing to all residents. But it hasn’t said when that will be available."
171,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-biden-idUSKBN26902H,-2.943,Biden rejects Trump claim that COVID-19 vaccine is imminent,"(Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Thursday bluntly contradicted President Donald Trump’s suggestion that a coronavirus vaccine may be only weeks away, warning Americans they cannot trust the president’s word.
“The idea that there’s going to be a vaccine and everything’s gonna be fine tomorrow - it’s just not rational,” Biden said during a CNN town hall in Moosic, Pennsylvania.
Trump again said on Wednesday that a vaccine for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, could be ready for distribution ahead of the Nov. 3 election.
Most health experts, including Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have said a vaccine will likely not be widely available until mid-2021.
Trump has accused Biden of spreading “anti-vaccine rhetoric,” while Biden has emphasized that he will listen to scientists, not the president, regarding a vaccine’s safety.
The broadcast was the first town hall-style event for Biden since he accepted the Democratic nomination last month, giving viewers a rare chance to see him answer live questions from people whose votes he hopes to win in November.
The cable network described the event as a “drive-in town hall”: participants remained at their parked cars outdoors to ensure they stayed safely distanced from one another.
Biden spent much of the evening attacking Trump for his handling of the pandemic, including the president’s own admission to the journalist Bob Woodward that he deliberately downplayed the disease’s deadliness.
“He knew it and did nothing,” Biden said. “It’s close to criminal.”
Trump has subsequently said he was trying to avoid panic.
Biden said he did not have the power to enforce a national mask mandate, walking back remarks he made on Wednesday in which he suggested the president could legally require masks amid a national emergency. But he vowed to encourage every governor to do so while criticizing Trump for questioning the efficacy of masks.
Biden also took advantage of the event’s setting near his birthplace of Scranton, comparing his working-class upbringing with what he derided as Trump’s “Park Avenue” background.
“Guys like me who were the first of my family to go to college... We are as good as anybody,” he said. “And guys like Trump, who inherited everything and squandered what they inherited, are the people that I’ve always had a problem with - not the people who are busting their neck.”
He said he would accept the results of the election, a stance that Trump has declined to adopt amid his unfounded claims that the widespread use of mail-in ballots due to the pandemic will cause massive fraud.
Electoral experts have said voter fraud is exceedingly rare in the United States, where voting by mail is a longstanding practice in many states.
For much of the summer, Biden held mostly virtual events from his home in Delaware, drawing criticism from Trump that he was “hiding.” But Biden maintained an advantage in national opinion polls throughout, as the pandemic battered Trump’s standing among voters.
In recent weeks, Biden has begun to hold campaign events again in other states, but they have been largely devoid of attendees aside from reporters and invited guests in a nod to the coronavirus.
Trump, who has returned to holding large-scale rallies, participated in an ABC town hall with undecided voters earlier this week, where he defended his administration’s response to the outbreak.
At an outdoor rally in Mosinee, Wisconsin, on Thursday night, Trump told supporters that Biden “would absolutely eradicate your state’s economy” and mocked the CNN event for keeping attendees apart in cars.
COVID-19 has killed more than 195,000 people in the United States, the most of any country.
Biden and Trump will both travel to Minnesota on Friday, the first day of early voting there.

Eyewitness News was on Temple’s Main Campus in North Philadelphia.
The college confirmed a total of 318 coronavirus cases, including one staff member who tested positive.
Students were seen packed up cars and moving back home on Saturday.

“It’s kind of frustrating because I thought it was going to work out the first time but we only lasted a week,” Mikayla Capasso, a freshman from New Jersey, said. “It’s kind of a hassle to bring everything back home again, but it is what it is.”
“I’m confident that they’ll be able to possibly get this all under control and be able to move forward once the middle of January comes,” Koletta Weinberg, a parent of another student, said.
All classes will move from 75% virtual instruction and 25% in-person to 95% online and 5% on campus for the remainder of the fall semester.
“These are folks who must be present on campus to do something physically that can’t be simulated online. So for example a nursing student, physical therapy student, occupational therapy student,” Temple spokesperson Ray Betzner said.
Temple says there are academic and other support services available to students who remain on campus, including the health services.
For the 3,000 students remaining in residence halls, they have until Sunday, Sept. 13 to move out if they want a full refund on rent and meal plans.
“My parents want the refund so they’re like, ‘we’ll get you an apartment. I just want their money back,'” freshman Rayna George said.
“It’s like the disappointed but not surprised kinda feeling. I don’t know what Temple was really expecting by bringing us back,” sophomore Stephen Fiora said.
A Temple spokesperson says the school will continue to work with the health department on campaigns to help students better understand the gravity of COVID-19 so they can access their behavior to lower the risk for themselves and the surrounding community.
The university will decide if the spring semester will be entirely online or in-person."
175,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/16/us/for-school-outbreaks-its-when-not-if.html,-2.499,"For School Outbreaks, It’s When, Not If","This is the Coronavirus Schools Briefing, a guide to the seismic changes in U.S. education that are taking place during the pandemic. Sign up here to get this newsletter in your inbox.
The coronavirus is unpredictable, but one thing seems certain in this back-to-school season: Outbreaks will appear in many K-12 schools as they reopen.
“It’s not a question of if, but when outbreaks will occur,” said Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and the former health commissioner of Baltimore.
“We have to be realistic,” said Dr. Benjamin Linas, an associate professor of medicine and epidemiology at Boston University. “If we are opening schools, there will be some Covid.”
That inevitability can feel frightening. But a case at your child’s school does not mean you should panic. And a classroom in quarantine, or a school forced to switch to remote learning, does not necessarily mean a district has failed. In fact, if your school is following an established pandemic procedure, it might mean things are working as planned.
Here are a few questions and suggestions to help you calibrate your concern and weigh contingencies, based on our conversations with epidemiologists and public health experts.
If there’s a case, where did that person get exposed?
“It’s important to distinguish between Covid in your school, which is bad, but not exactly the same thing as Covid being transmitted in your school,” Dr. Linas said. “People have lives outside of school. It’s very likely that people will get infected somewhere else.”
A few unrelated cases at a school does not necessarily mean there’s an outbreak. If community transmission rates are high, students are most likely getting infected outside of school, where the environment is less controlled. (Most experts agree that students shouldn’t return to school if more than 5 percent of people in their community test positive.) Effective contact tracing is essential to help families and classrooms assess risks and make a plan.
How transparent is your district?
Just because there’s a case in your child’s school, it doesn’t mean that your child has been exposed. “By just passing a kid in a hallway, your kid is extremely unlikely to get Covid-19,” said Dr. Megan Ranney, an emergency physician and assistant dean at Brown University. “It’s really about being in a classroom with that other person for a significant period of time.”
If your child hasn’t been anywhere near the infected child, she said, “it would not be appropriate for your kid to quarantine.”
But transparency about cases varies across districts. Some, citing privacy concerns, are only releasing limited data — if any at all. But that might be because they’re interpreting HIPAA incorrectly. Either way, dashboards and trackers are slowly popping up across the country, under pressure from parents and doctors. Detailed, reliable information about outbreaks can keep learning as uninterrupted as possible and may save lives.
What about testing?
Pediatric tests have been hard to get in some places, but they are available. Try to find a center that turns around results quickly.
If there’s any chance your child may have the virus, don’t send them back to school without a negative test, because research suggests they can be asymptomatic but still contagious. And if they have symptoms — even sniffles or an upset tummy — play it extra safe.
“This is not the year to just send your kid to school,” Dr. Ranney said. “This is the year to respect the community and get your kid tested before sending them back.”
Outbreaks and responses
Michigan: For weeks, the state dragged its feet on releasing detailed information about outbreaks to parents and teachers, citing privacy concerns and sluggish computer systems. On Monday, the state released a list of all schools with coronavirus cases, from K-12 through college.
Connecticut: A number of schools had temporarily switched to online learning after a few positive cases. (Many students in the state are back in classrooms full time.) Gov. Ned Lamont challenged that approach as overly cautious because each classroom functions as a pod. “If there happens to be an infection in that one class, it’s just those 20 students and that teacher who would have to quarantine — not the entire middle school or not the entire school,” he told WNPR. The state’s test positivity rate has consistently hovered around 1 percent.
Minnesota: School leaders spent the summer making plans for contact tracing and pivots between in-person and distance learning as cases pop up. A rapid-response team is now trying to implement those procedures and protocols.
Germany: In the first week of school, the country reported 31 clusters, and 150 total cases. But The Washington Post reports that there have been few documented cases of transmission within schools, and while national cases have been rising, the schools have not been “identified as a driver of infections.” Officials said that’s because of low community transmission rates, more than any school-specific policy. “This is where the United States will have problems,” one doctor said.
The Big Ten calls an audible
The athletic conference, which said on Aug. 11 that it would not hold any football games in 2020, abruptly reversed its decision after coming under intense pressure from coaches, parents, players, fans and even President Trump.
Football for teams like Michigan, Nebraska, Ohio State, Penn State and Wisconsin will now resume as soon as Oct. 23, with safeguards including daily coronavirus testing and enhanced cardiac screening. (In a recent small study out of Ohio State, 15 percent of athletes who tested positive for the virus showed signs of cardiac inflammation. )
Reinstating the season is likely to provoke new outrage from those who believe the league is prioritizing profits, entertainment and public relations peace over the health and safety of student-athletes.

The latest on how schools are reopening amid the pandemic.
A North Carolina college student described as “super healthy” by his family died of rare complications from Covid-19.
Elementary school students in New York City returned to their classrooms on Tuesday for the first time in six months.
The pandemic is imperiling promotions for women in academia.
Students say that digital proctoring programs like Proctorio and ExamSoft discourage them in the moments they’re trying to prove themselves.
Back in August, Kevin Warren, the Big Ten commissioner said: “There’s a lot of emotion involved with this, but when you look at the health and well-being of our student-athletes, I feel very confident that we made the right decision.” Later that month, he said the decision “would not be revisited.”
College football conferences that have returned to play, like the Atlantic Coast Conference and the Big 12, have found it tricky to navigate the epidemiological perils of the pandemic. A handful of games have been postponed, some teams have held out players because of positive tests or contact tracing, and stadiums are operating with fewer spectators in the stands or none at all.
The coach of Louisiana State’s football team, the reigning national champions, said on Tuesday that most of his players had already contracted the coronavirus, including “about three or four guys” who had active cases, The Baton Rouge Advocate reported.

College updates
The Times has a detailed look at SUNY Oneonta, which was forced to shut down after hundreds of students tested positive soon after the campus reopened.
More than 450 additional students have tested positive at Penn State. The university says there are now more than 1,100 confirmed cases at the main campus.
On campuses across the country, students are resorting to gallows humor on social media.
K-12 updates
In New York City, a small army of school chefs and cooks fed millions throughout the summer. Now, they’re gearing up for students eating in schools, which are set to open next week. But much is still uncertain.
In Massachusetts, students who may have been exposed to an infected student still came to class.
The chief executive of Baltimore schools told WYPR that only 65 percent of students are logging on every day without interruption, one week into the school year, according to a tweet from Alec MacGillis, a reporter at ProPublica. “That means 27,000 students are not reliably present, despite the district’s considerable tech & outreach efforts,” he wrote.
Around the world
The United Nations projects that at least 24 million children will drop out of school because of the pandemic.
Students in Denmark are learning outside, using nature as their classroom and staying at a social distance.
Israel will close schools on Thursday, a day earlier than planned, after new cases surged to a record: 5,523 in a single day.
Listen: Inside quarantine dorms
Today on The Daily: What life is like for one University of Alabama sophomore under quarantine. Zoie Terry, 19, spoke to our colleague Natasha Singer about her life in isolation.
She had tested negative before she returned to campus and was thinking “there was no way I could have had the virus because I was following every guideline — I was doing nothing, I was in my room 24/7,” she said.
But Terry still tested positive. Her story might be indicative of how cases are spreading on college campuses.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reversed itself and recommended people get tested if they come in contact with an infected person even if they don’t have symptoms.
New York Mayor Bill de Blasio voiced confidence that students can return to schools at the end of September after two delays. Deaths in California fell below the 14-day average.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire became the most senior French politician and one of the most prominent in Europe to test positive for the virus. Lockdowns loomed larger as French daily cases jumped by 13,000, the most since May, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson weighed whether the U.K. needs to “go further” with national restrictions.

U.S. Cases Rise 0.7% (4 p.m. NY)
Coronavirus cases in the U.S. increased 0.7% as compared with the same time Thursday to 6.7 million, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News. The increase compares with an average daily increase of 0.6% over the past week. Deaths reached 198,114.
Florida reported 677,660 cases on, up 0.5% from a day earlier, compared to an average 0.4% increase in the previous seven days. Deaths reached 13,225, an increase of 1.1%, or 139.Arizona reported 1,281 new virus cases, below Thursday’s spike of 1,753, but the 0.6% increase was still double the rate of the prior seven-day period. The state now has 212,942 cases. Arizone recorded 42 new Covid-19 deaths, bringing the toll to 5,451.Alaska experienced a 3.3% increase in the number of cases from the same time yesterday, bringing the total to 6,644, according to the data.
Trump Sees U.S. Fully Vaccinated by April (3:13 p.m. NY)
President Donald Trump said his administration expects to be able to vaccinate every American against the novel coronavirus by April.
“We’ll have manufactured at least 100 million vaccine doses” by the end of the year, Trump said at a news conference on Friday. “We expect to have enough vaccines for every American by April.”
Trump’s timetable is more ambitious than those of drug industry executives and health officials including Anthony Fauci and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield, who have said most Americans shouldn’t expect a shot before mid-2021.
French Finance Chief Says He Tested Positive (3:13 p.m. NY)
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday, he said on Twitter.
Le Maire said he has no symptoms, and will continue to exercise his ministerial duties while quarantining for seven days.
CDC Backtracks on Virus Testing (2:25 p.m. NY)
Anyone who has spent 15 minutes or more within six feet of a person infected with Covid-19 should be tested, the CDC said in new guidelines. And even if the test is negative, an exposed person should still self-quarantine for 14 days.
Those who are in an area of high virus transmission and go to a large gathering with spotty public-health precautions may be advised to get a test by their doctor or a public-health official.
People who don’t have symptoms and aren’t in close contact of an infected person still don’t require a screening, unless it’s recommended by a medical provider or public-health official.
U.K.’s Johnson Warns of Further Curbs (2 p.m. NY)
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he is considering whether to “go further” with national restrictions after a surge in coronavirus infections in the U.K. raised the specter of another economy-sapping lockdown. London Mayor Sadiq Khan warned restrictions could be imposed if infections aren’t slowed.
With official daily cases running at levels last seen in May, the U.K.’s test-and-trace system is under strain and millions of people across the country have been placed under local restrictions to limit the spread of the disease.
California Deaths Edge Up (2 p.m. NY)
California reported 3,630 new virus cases, above the 14-day average of 3,396, according to the health department’s website. There have been a total of 769,831 cases in the state. The number of deaths increased by 91, below the 14-day average of 91, to 14,812.
France Cases Jump to Highest Since May (1:35 p.m. NY)
France’s daily coronavirus cases topped 13,000, the highest since the end of lockdown in May. Health officials blame the increase on social gatherings, especially among younger people, and on travelers bringing the virus back from vacation.
Arizona’s 7-Day Rate Jumps (1:23 p.m. NY)
Arizona on Friday reported 1,281 new virus cases, below Thursday’s spike of 1,753, but the 0.6% increase was still double the rate of the prior seven-day period. The state now has 212,942 cases. The state Department of Health Services recorded 42 new Covid-19 deaths, bringing the toll to 5,451.
Dublin Bans Indoor Dining (1:20 p.m. NY)
The Irish government on Friday slapped extra curbs on Dublin, as cases in the city spiked. Indoor dining in bars and restaurants will be banned, travel in and out the region will be restricted and Dubliners have been told to avoid international travel. Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin said without these restrictions, Dublin risked returning to the worst of the pandemic. The restrictions will be reviewed in three weeks.
Lebanon Cases Spike, Spain Numbers Tick Up (12:50 p.m. NY)
Lebanon reported a record 750 new coronavirus cases on Friday. There has been a surge in cases since the massive blast in the capital last month leveled its port, killed more than 180 people and injured thousands.
Meanwhile, Spain recorded 4,697 coronavirus infections in the last 24 hours, up 156 from the previous day. There were 432 fatalities in the past week, an increase from 419 in the previous seven days.
Guatemala President Tests Positive for Covid (12:35 p.m. NY)
Guatemala President Alejandro Giammattei tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday night, he told local radio station Sonora on Friday morning. The Central American nation has reported 83,664 total cases of the novel coronavirus and 3,036 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.
Russia Clears Drug for Pharmacy Sales (11:35 a.m. NY)
Russia has approved its first drug to treat Covid-19 for sale in pharmacies, its maker R-Pharm said in a statement.
Coronavir underwent successful Phase 3 trials on 168 patients with Covid-19 and can treat people with mild to moderate cases, the company said. It could arrive in pharmacies as soon as next week.
Coronavir and Avifavir, another Russian drug that has been in use in hospitals since June, are based on favipiravir, an antiviral medicine that has had inconclusive results fighting Covid-19 in international studies.
Russia was the first country in the world to approve a Covid-19 vaccine for widespread use, registering it in August before Phase 3 trials had established its safety or effectiveness. Inoculations of medical workers could begin in October even as studies continue.
Greece Restricts Offices, Social Events in Athens Area (11:30 a.m. NY)
Greece tightened anti-pandemic measures for the second time in four days in the greater Athens area, where cases doubled in the past two weeks.
“It’s clear that there is an issue with the coronavirus in Attica that needs to be addressed,” Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said Friday.
Public and private gatherings in the region were limited to nine people, concerts were suspended and indoor cinemas closed. Weddings and similar events will be limited to 20 people from Monday until Oct. 4. Businesses must have 40% of employees work from home during the period.
Italy’s Cases Rise the Most Since May 1 (10:50 a.m. NY)
Italy reported 1,907 new cases on Friday, the highest daily increase since May 1, compared with 1,585 the previous day. New deaths declined to 10 from 13 on the day.
The number of Covid-19 patients in intensive care at hospitals declined by four to 208. That compares with a peak of more than 4,000 ICU patients in early April.
Florida’s Positive-Test Streak at Lowest Since June (11:15 a.m. NY)
Florida reported 677,660 Covid-19 cases on Friday, up 0.5% from a day earlier, compared to an average 0.4% increase in the previous seven days. That’s a daily change of 3,204 cases, according to the health department report, which includes data through Thursday.
The new daily rate of people testing positive for the first time fell to 4.2% for Thursday, from 4.4% on Wednesday. The rate has been under 5% for seven consecutive days, a streak last matched in the period ending June 8.
Deaths among Florida residents reached 13,225, an increase of 1.1%, or 139.
Vienna Curtails Its Waltz-Celebrating Ball Season (10:50 a.m. NY)
Some of the best-known events of the Viennese ball season were canceled on Friday amid Austria’s surge in infections. There’s no decision yet about the world-famous Vienna Opera.
Physical distancing rules “are the opposite of a ball’s basic idea,” a spokeswoman for the Committee of the Viennese Traditional and Noble Balls was quoted as telling the APA newswire.
Portuguese Leader Pleads With Public (10:40 a.m. NY)
Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa pleaded for people to use face coverings and follow distancing rules as new cases increase. “It’s not inevitable,” he said Friday. “We can stop this growth.”
The country is reporting the biggest rises in daily cases since April. There were 780 new cases in the latest 24 hour period, 10 more than on Thursday, taking the total to 67,176. Covid-19 patients in hospitals and intensive care fell.
Costa has said he wants avoid the “enormous cost” of lockdown measures adopted in March and April.
French Sports Teams Become Hotbeds (9:17 a.m. NY)
France’s soccer and rugby clubs have become hot spots for spread of the coronavirus after training and competition resumed following a summer break.
Since the end of July, health authorities have reported 88 Covid-19 clusters linked to sports clubs, most of them in the first two weeks of September, France’s public health agency said late Thursday.
U.K. Spread Accelerating With Lockdown Not Ruled Out (9:07 a.m. NY)
Boris Johnson’s government extended coronavirus restrictions across northern England and the Midlands, as ministers refused to rule out a short national lockdown to tackle a surge in infections.
Residents in parts of northwest England, the Midlands and West Yorkshire face measures including a ban on socializing with other people outside their own households, the Department of Health said on Friday.
For the U.K., the so-called R rate, or how many people each new Covid-19 case infects, is as high as 1.4, the government said, indicating the spread is accelerating.
De Blasio Vows to Avoid ‘Easy Way’ of Remote Classes (9:04 a.m. NY)
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said he has confidence in his latest timeline for in-class learning and won’t “take the easy way” by instituting all-remote learning for the nation’s largest school district.
“Remote education is easier, it’s less helpful for our kids and our families, it sets them back and we’re not going to let that happen,” de Blasio said Friday in an interview on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” program.
On Thursday, four days before all New York City schools were to reopen for in-person instruction, the mayor delayed classes for elementary schoolers until Sept. 29 and for middle- and high-school students until Oct. 1. The move, which followed an earlier delay that pushed the reopening to Sept. 21 from Sept. 10, frustrated parents and raised questions over whether the city would follow districts like Chicago and Los Angeles to start the year online.
Denmark Broadens Restrictions (8:35 a.m. NY)
Denmark is introducing a nationwide limit of 50 people on public gatherings and early closing times for bars and restaurants amid a record rise in Covid-19 cases.
From Saturday and until Oct. 4, businesses will be encouraged to let their employees work from home wherever possible. Citizens will be asked to limit their social circles, wear face masks in bars and restaurants and avoid public transport during rush hour, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said at a press conference in Copenhagen.
Prague Closes Universities, Schools Still Open (7:17 a.m. NY)
The city of Prague ordered its universities to close for in-person learning after the Czech Republic reported a record jump in new coronavirus cases.
Starting next week, higher-education classes will move online in the city of 1.3 million people, Prague Mayor Zdenek Hrib said on Twitter Friday. He said he had also wanted to close high-schools, but public-health officials rejected his proposal.
EU Seals Vaccine-Supply Deal With Sanofi/GSK (7:07 a.m. NY)
The European Commission announced a contract with drugmakers Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline on the purchase of as many as 300 million doses of any successful Covid-19 vaccine.
The commission, the European Union’s executive arm in Brussels, said in late July it had concluded exploratory talks with Sanofi/GSK for the supply of that number of doses for EU countries. The deal is the second EU advance purchase agreement following one with AstraZeneca.
U.S. Approaches 200,000 Virus Deaths (7 a.m. NY)
The U.S. will top 200,000 deaths from the novel coronavirus in coming days, a devastating milestone that comes eight months after the pathogen was first confirmed on American soil. The U.S., with 4% of the world’s population, accounts for about 21% of global coronavirus deaths.
With a population of 330 million, the U.S. reached 100,000 Covid-19 deaths on May 27, four months after the first recorded case. It has taken another four months to reach 197,633 as of Thursday evening, according to Johns Hopkins University. That’s a number roughly equal to the population of Yonkers, New York, or Huntsville, Alabama. Brazil ranks second in deaths, with almost 135,000 in a nation of 210 million.
London Faces Restrictions (5:49 p.m. HK)
London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he will be announcing restrictions over the “next few days and weeks.” While keen to avoid a version of lockdown used in other parts of the country, such steps were still a possibility, he said, according to LBC.
Earlier on Friday, the Evening Standard reported a surge of Covid-19 cases in London. The capital has recorded about 25 cases per 100,000 over the last seven days, rising from 18.8, according to the report, which didn’t say how it obtained the information.
Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also warned of “hard and difficult decisions in the coming days.”

177,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/black-families-wary-of-return-to-school-ive-seen-the-system-fail-us/ar-BB19b6hm,-1.661,"Black families wary of return to school: ""I've seen the system fail us""","For Clarice Doctor, a single mom in New Jersey, asking her daughter to start her senior year through distance learning rather than her high school's in-person option was one of the hardest moments she's had as a parent. But for her family, it was the only option that felt safe.
Doctor had many reasons. She shares a home with her parents, who are at high risk for the coronavirus. She's concerned about the virus's deadly impact on communities of color. She's noticed other families not taking it as seriously as her own.
But her biggest concern is one that began long before the outbreak of COVID-19: As a Black woman, she said, she doesn't trust the system to work for her.
""Time and time again I've seen the system fail us. How can I trust it now?"" Doctor said in an interview with CBS News.
She isn't alone. CBS News spoke to dozens of Black families, all of whom expressed reluctance to send their children back to in-person learning in the midst of the pandemic. Study after study shows that families of color are much more likely to have safety concerns over in-person learning this fall. According to a Washington Post-Schar School survey conducted by Ipsos in late July, nearly 80% of Black and 72% of Hispanic parents responded it was ""not safe"" to have their children attend in-person classes this fall. But only 43% of White families felt the same.
As schools have developed plans for returning students to class safely, many Black families have been wary about how those protections would apply to their children and their community, highlighting what, Howard Stevenson, a professor of urban education and Africana studies at the University Pennsylvania, called a historical distrust in ""the system."" The distrust has gotten worse during the Trump administration, Stevenson said.
""Black people have always had to read between the lines, because what people say and what they do are very different,"" Stevenson said. ""As the saying goes, 'If it's a sneeze in the White community it's pneumonia in the Black community.'""
Shakira Reynolds, a Black mother in California's Bay Area, used the same phrase to express her hesitations about sending her two boys back to in-person learning in the midst of a pandemic. Though she had major concerns over sending her children back to a physical classroom, her two sons, both of whom are autistic, benefit immensely from in-person learning, she said. This fall, one of her sons is doing remote learning while the other is attending in-person classes at a school where her husband works.""Yes, I'm concerned if my boys can't read, but I want them to be alive,"" Reynolds said.
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been particularly devastating in communities of color. The rate of hospitalization is nearly five times higher among Black Americans than it is for White people, and 4.6 times higher among Hispanic and Latino people, according to data provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A coronavirus infection for a Black patient is more than twice as likely to result in death than it is for a White patient, according to the CDC's data.
The federal health agency pointed to racial discrimination as one of the factors contributing to the disproportionately high rates of hospitalization and death among patients of color. The CDC says other factors include higher rates of medical conditions like diabetes that increase risk, plus gaps in income, wealth, education and health care coverage, and a greater likelihood of working in frontline jobs.
In Oxford, Mississippi, Cindy, a single Black mother of four, has seen firsthand the devastation of the virus. Members of her church have gotten sick, she said, and she's seen Facebook posts announcing the deaths of peripheral friends. She's also noticed the White community in her city hasn't been as impacted.
""It's like we're living in two different worlds,"" said Cindy, who asked that her real name not be used.Indeed, learning-model preferences appear to reflect Cindy's observation. Just over half — 54% — of the Black students in Cindy's school district opted to begin the school year remotely, according Heather Lenard, a spokesperson for Oxford's schools, while less than 20% of Oxford's White students chose remote learning.Lenard pointed to several factors contributing to the divide, including a prevalence of multigenerational households and higher rates of underinsured or uninsured Black families.""There's an extra layer of fear [in the Black community],"" Lenard said.
But that racial divide appears to have gone largely unnoticed by many school districts. When surveying parents on their learning preferences, many systems, including most of the largest districts in the country, didn't ask about race.
""The schools are thinking universally and you think it's a pretty benign question, except you're not comparing the life experiences across these different racial parenting groups,"" Stevenson said.
The question of race is a common omission. Medical trials, surveys and research often neglect to account for how the world impacts people of color differently, resulting in incomplete and whitewashed conclusions, said Stevenson.
At Freehold Regional School District, Doctor's system in New Jersey, 75% of parents opted for in-person learning, according to a spokesperson for the district. But the district, like many others, didn't account for the race of the student, the spokesperson told CBS News. As of September 1, there was no data to reflect the learning-model preferences of families of different backgrounds, the spokesperson said.
Freehold Regional is predominantly White. Of the district's 10,500 students, 73.8% are White, 12.1% are Latinx and 9.1% are Asian. Clarice's daughter is among the district's 3.5% of Black students.
""Black moms don't really feel heard,"" said Eboni Taylor, an executive director at Mothering Justice, a Michigan-based political group focused on the needs of moms. ""We haven't been given a lot of reason to trust the system. Why would we trust it now, and with our most precious thing: our child.""
At first glance, resistance to in-person learning from communities of color doesn't make sense, said Taylor, a Black mom of two young boys. Black workers disproportionately fill frontline jobs in fields like retail and food service — employment that's impossible to do from home and that has experienced some of the most devastating job losses since the onset of the pandemic. Because of that, Black families have been among the hardest hit by coronavirus-related economic fallout. More than half of Black women say they've lost income since March, and 1 in 5 report not having enough food in the past week, according to a recent report from the National Women's Law Center.
But for parents locked into unforgiving work schedules that don't allow any work from home option, an unexpected school closure or quarantine can be disastrous, Taylor said. That's led many families to prefer remote learning to avoid the possibility of last-minute changes and disruptions, Taylor said.
This fall, Taylor is sending her sons back for in-person learning, but only because their small private school is offering an entirely outdoor curriculum. ""It was the only way I could do it,"" she said. Once the weather gets colder, Taylor said they'll probably pivot to remote.
Experts worry that the stark racial differences in learning-model preferences could worsen the already-problematic achievement gap, a measure by which researchers measure educational differences. A recent study from McKinsey & Company, a New York-based consulting firm, found that if students do not resume in-person learning by January 2021, Black students could experience more than 10 months of learning loss. That loss could exacerbate average achievement gaps between White students and those of color by 15% to 20%, the study found. If Black students indeed are staying home in higher numbers than their White classmates this fall, the gap could grow even further.
But Taylor said that in such an unprecedented time, many Black families don't have the luxury to worry about things like an achievement gap.
""The achievement gap is secondary, dare I say tertiary, to survival right now,"" Taylor said. ""It can't compete with survival."""
178,https://www.daily-chronicle.com/2020/09/17/4-new-niu-covid-19-cases-announced-on-thursday/alp9g45/,0.0,4 new NIU COVID-19 cases announced on Thursday,"Forty students and three employees are currently positive. The school hasn't reported double-digit cases in a single day since reporting 73 on Sept. 8, which represented a four-day total but still averaged more than 18 cases per day.
According to the school, 7.6% of its quarantine and isolation areas are in use.
The university welcomed students back to campus Aug. 19, and classes began Aug. 24. Students living on campus were required to submit proof of a negative COVID-19 test before move-in. NIU reported that of the 2,037 tested before move-in, 39 tested positive, and the university will welcome them back once their quarantine period is over.
According to the school, the 14-day quarantine begins after the student first shows a symptom, not when a student receives a positive test for the virus. A case is considered 'recovered' after the 14-day period is over.
Of the 383 students tested last week per NIU's surveillance testing program, five positive cases were identified, according to new data Monday. It was a 1.3% positivity rating, up from 0.43 in the program's first week.
The surveillance program the week prior returned one positive case out of 231 tests during the week of Sept. 8. The program tests about 125 students a day at random as an attempt to better assess and catch viral outbreaks on campus more quickly to mitigate continued community spread.
Although specific surveillance testing results will be reported weekly on Mondays, positive tests produced from the program will be included in daily statistics. The surveillance testing will continue while the undergraduate courses remain online.
Daily COVID-19 case data from the DeKalb County Health Department may not reflect daily data from NIU because some students or employees may live outside the county and still test positive for the virus.
NIU staff are encouraged to get tested via state testing sites or their health care provider on their own. Students living off campus in Greek housing and otherwise also are not required to get tested, although anyone experiencing symptoms is asked to remain at home.
Students living on campus paid a $7.90 per credit hour health fee at the beginning of the semester, which covers the nasal swab testing services at Northwestern Medicine Student Health Center in the Health Services Building on campus."

Nicole Hassoun, Binghamton University, State University of New York
(THE CONVERSATION) A committee of The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine is readying a report with recommendations for equitable distribution of a COVID-19 vaccine. In this Q&A, bioethicist Dr. Nicole Hassoun of Binghamton University breaks down the elements in the recently published draft report from the committee and explains the key questions around vaccine distribution.
Why is there a need for guidelines on how to distribute a COVID-19 vaccine?
It’s clear that there won’t be enough vaccines for everybody initially. It just takes a long time to get 300 million doses of vaccine made, and if we’re looking at November as a potential date for a new vaccine, then people start thinking about, “Well, what are we going to do when there’s not enough?” And that’s where this proposal and others might fit in.
How does the National Academies’ report approach this problem?
There are four phases to their distribution suggestions. First, they suggest giving the vaccine to high-risk workers and health care facilities and first responders. Then to people of all ages who have multiple medical conditions who are at higher risk for illness, as well as older adults who live in crowded settings like nursing homes.
The next thing they suggest is helping critical-care workers. That is, workers who are in jobs that are both really important for society and at high risk of exposure. For example, this would be teachers, school staff, people of all ages who have conditions that put them at higher risk, as well as older adults who didn’t already get the vaccine. This phase also includes people at homeless shelters and prisons and other detention centers.
In phase 3, they would give the vaccine to young adults and children as well as people who are in industries essential to society that haven’t already received it.
And finally, everyone in the U.S. would get a chance to have the vaccine if they haven’t already gotten it.
Within each group, they will deploy the Social Deprivation Index, which comes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and looks at a variety of different kinds of deprivation, such as poverty or overcrowded housing. If you have a higher deprivation index or higher vulnerability index, then within that group, you’ll get it first.
What’s the rationale behind these phases?
The authors of the report say their first priority is to maximize social benefit by reducing death and disability and transmission rates. So at first they’ll help try to prevent death and disability and then focus on constraining transmission. But they don’t explain exactly what it means to reduce death and disability. I think they have to explain how to measure that. Instead, they shift to talking about different risk groups.
So they define people in different categories, like children and adults, but also describe different kinds of risks. They talk about the risk of acquiring infection, the risk of getting really sick or dying if you get COVID-19, the risk of negative social impact if individuals have a high-priority job, and the risk of transmitting disease to others. And then they rank everybody on these different categories and tell us who should get the vaccine first.

Is there an alternative approach to vaccine rationing?
I think what matters more than rationing is changing pharmaceutical incentives and rules for innovation. About 80% of pharmaceutical manufacturing is done on generics, which means there’s a huge manufacturing capacity on the generic side of things, whereas only 20% is on patented medicines. If we let companies keep patents on those products, then they can charge what they want for those medicines or maybe they have advance purchase agreements with the government. But we can’t use a lot of that manufacturing capacity, and so there’ll be a lot less supply of the vaccine.
I think we can tie incentives to what I call global health impact, which encourages companies to focus on the biggest problems that cause the most death and disability. This goes well beyond the pandemic by using things like prize funds. So companies are rewarded for innovations based on the health impact of those innovations. Another example is the orphan drug tax credit, a tax incentive to develop cures for diseases that affect a relatively small group of people. Big pharma companies are some of the richest fortune 500 companies, and they say great profits are necessary for getting research and development done. But they don’t make their costs transparent. Critics say they’re over-inflated and that they include a lot of unethical marketing costs in the data that they provide.
At the minimum, I think companies should substantiate the claim that their profits are justified for the government to offer them the kind of patent protections that contribute to inequitable access.
What would be your approach to equitable vaccine distribution?
I think that if I had to decide how to distribute a vaccine, I would try to save the most lives and not the most life-years, which I think might be driving the National Academies’ proposal. They want to maximize the greatest number of years lived across the population, as opposed to total number of lives. They put children in a higher risk group than I think is merited and maybe give the elderly less priority than I would. I think that arguments which focus on life-years aren’t that great. For each person, their life matters so much to them, however long they might have left to live which I think is sufficient reason to treat that person equally.
I think a lot of things matter besides saving lives. The economic consequences of a pandemic, for instance, are really important. We have to know how to trade off lives against economic consequences to try to deal with that within a vaccine allocation system. I think there may be a tension between helping people go back to work, protecting the elderly, getting kids to school – but we can also use economic policies to address some of the economic problems. So I think a truly ethical proposal would treat every person equally and help countries get vaccines to people when they don’t have the capacity to do that on their own.

Heidi Hussli, 47, a Beaver Dam native who lived in Suamico, followed her mother into education, teaching German at Bay Port High School for 16 years. Hussli had studied German at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay and educational leadership at the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh.
""She loved German culture so much,"" said Amber Viegut, a Bay Port English teacher.
""She took dozens of kids, including our principal's son, to Germany,"" Viegut said. ""She made countless trips to Chicago to the Christmas market. She led amazing cultural events at the school, too. My favorite memory is her yearly dress-up for Oktoberfest.""
Hussli is believed to be the first area schoolteacher with COVID-19 to die since the school year began several weeks ago. A colleague said Hussli was in classes the week of Sept. 8, became ill over the weekend and was unable to return to class.
She is survived by a husband and son. Her mother passed away in late August.
Coronavirus in Wisconsin Schools: Search and track COVID-19 cases
District officials announced they would have counselors available Friday at Bay Port. Also, the school will suspend online and in-person classes on Monday and Tuesday, but will be open for students and staff who desire support.
""This news is heart-wrenching to all of us who have known Heidi. Her positivity and passion for her students and her craft left a lasting mark on our school community,"" Superintendent Damian LaCroix wrote in a letter to parents.
Counseling will be available over the phone or online by appointment.
As of noon Thursday, Bay Port was reporting nine positive cases of COVID-19, eight involving students. Eight staff and 31 students were under quarantine.
In total, the Howard-Suamico district reported two teachers and a total 10 students across the district's eight schools have tested positive for COVID-19. The schools and the district office have a total of 130 students and 30 teachers and staff in quarantine.
Under the school district's reopening plan, Bay Port students attend in-person classes two days a week (Monday/Wednesday or Tuesday/Thursday), with remote learning the other two days. Fridays are reserved for students to attend school in-person or remotely and participate in labs, personal fitness, interest-based learning, clubs/organization meetings. Student attendance in-person is not required on Fridays.
Hussli is also being remembered at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay, where she studied German.
“Heidi was a 1997 graduate of UW-Green Bay and a longtime and beloved German teacher at Bay Port,"" professor David Coury, who heads UWGB's German program, said in a statement. ""She was a German major who went on a study abroad trip with (assistant professor) Jennifer Ham and me. As a teacher, she took her students to Germany and hosted many German students here.""
Coury said UWGB German students ""were greatly impacted by her enthusiasm, and love of Germany and the German language.”
Howard-Suamico School District officials issued this statement Thursday.

182,https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-09/utau-cit091820.php,-0.432,Confidence in the authorities' handling of COVID-19 provides good mental health,"In March 2020, Covid-19 was declared a global pandemic, and governments around the world imposed restrictions to reduce the spread of the Coronavirus. Some countries chose stricter measures than others. But what effect does social distancing and similar measures have on our mental health? How do we adapt?
Researchers at UiT have compared corona restrictions in six countries, and looked at psychological reactions among the population, their confidence in the restrictions and belief that the government is in control over Covid-19 in their countries.
They found that those who were satisfied with how the country fought the outbreak had better well-being and a lower perceived risk of getting Coronavirus.
Dissatisfaction created fear
- We found that those who were dissatisfied with the country's Covid-19 response saw the risk of getting the virus as greater, were more concerned and expressed reduced faith in the possibility of controlling the outbreak, says professor at the Department of Psychology, Gerit Pfuhl. Together with colleague Martin Mækelæ, and international research colleagues, Dr. Phuhl now present the recent results of the study in the journal Royal Society Open Science.
- Dissatisfaction with the government's reactions to Covid-19 led to increased stress levels and psychological reactions, Pfuhl says about the results.
- Regardless of which country they lived in, those who were dissatisfied with the measures were more tense and perceived the risk of getting Covid-19 over the next two months as higher than those who were satisfied with how the country fought the outbreak, the researcher says.
Pfuhl explains that if you experience that your country is not doing enough, then you have more fear, if you think your country is doing enough to fight the outbreak, then you are more relaxed about it and have less fear.
These new research results provide important insights for decision-makers on how to take care of the well - being of their population during a global crisis.
Large survey
The researchers sent out questionnaires via social media in Norway, Germany, Israel, Colombia, Brazil and the USA, countries that had varying degrees of strict and mild restrictions. 2285 people are included in the analysis. The survey was voluntary, and the participants were asked questions about restrictions and reactions, psychological factors, fear and knowledge, and general demographics.
Gerit Pfuhl emphasizes that this study has looked at the measures that were used early in the pandemic, namely 12-31 March.
- At that time Colombia and Israel, with a full lockdown, that had the strictest measures. The mildest, in comparison with the other five countries we examined, was the USA, says Dr. Pfuhl.
Most people coped well
So how did ordinary people cope with the situation that arose in March?
- Most people coped well. Older people better than younger people. And in Norway better than other countries, says Gerit Pfuhl.
- Among the countries we compared, Norway did very well in many areas. We had little problems with mental health, and we had confidence in that our own actions and the actions of the authorities were effective, says Martin Mækelæ who is a psychology student that has worked in the project.
He says that a large proportion of Norwegians expressed that they were satisfied with how the authorities handled the situation.
- There were very few in Norway who were very scared. But we should not ignore those few, says the Dr. Pfuhl. Some people wrote to us by email, or used an open response field in the survey to express their anxiety. Among other things, some were afraid that their partner would die of Covid-19 due to for instance heart disease, says Pfuhl.
She thinks it agrees well with what other researchers have found out, i.e. that a few are very scared but most coped quite well with the situation.
Trust in society is good for health
- The vast majority reported that they believed that infection control measures were effective, says Mækelæ.
- It's nice to see that we adapt. This means that despite the fact that the closure of society has changed the way of life, most people stayed calm and collected, and especially those who believe that their country will succeed in fighting the outbreak.
In other words, the more trust you have in society, the government, fellow citizens, and your own self-efficacy, the better it is for your own mental health.
- More than 90 percent of the population, perform infection-reducing actions, and most have self-efficacy, says Pfuhl.
When asked which restrictions are the most effective and which affect mental health the least, Pfuhl answers:
- Measures that prevent physical gatherings of people indoors are very effective. That is, fewer meetings or digital meetings - because this only creates physical distance but not social distance.
Important to communicate well
If we experienced the start of the pandemic again, and if you were part of the Norwegian government, would you do something different?
- It is hard to say. On the one hand, Norway reacted late, as did the whole of Europe, Pfuhl believes.
- On the other hand, Norway was quite good at communicating about the pandemic. The authorities were honest about the uncertainty about how serious it was.
- The government communicated well, but it could always have been better, given that the number of deaths is in itself not very informative.
She believes one must look relatively at such figures.
- That is, how many of those who tested positive died, and whether they died with or because of Coronavirus. This can reduce the fear that it is a very serious, deadly disease, the researcher concludes.

183,https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-09-covid-flu-twindemic.html,-1.9249999999999998,Researchers warn of COVID-19 and flu 'twindemic',"Even as the first wave of the pandemic still roils, fears are rising of a second crush of COVID-19 infections. But because the novel coronavirus is, well, novel, no one can yet say if that will happen. One thing is certain, though, another viral wave is coming: flu season.
Influenza season occurs during the cold half of the year in each hemisphere. In the United States, that's generally October to May, with peak activity December through February. After early hopes that the novel coronavirus might burn itself out in the summer heat, SARS-CoV-2 now appears more likely to be a year-round phenomenon.
""Many factors influence the prevalence of viruses,"" said Pascal Gagneux, professor of pathology and evolutionary biologist at University of California San Diego School of Medicine. ""These range from the behaviors of their human hosts and the vectors that transmit them to environmental conditions and their own adaptations.
""Coronaviruses have a genome almost three times as big as influenza A viruses so that gives them a larger and more complex bag of tricks to manipulate their hosts and evade their protective immune response. My guess at the moment is that SARS-CoV-2 will continue to remain a significant public health threat until there is an effective vaccine and some degree of herd immunity.""
If humans face the prospect of living with the dual threats of COVID-19 and influenza for at least part of every year, there are things to know and things to do to reduce risk of infection or, possibly, co-infection (a simultaneous infection of COVID-19 and the flu). Most immediately, that means getting this year's flu vaccination.
""There isn't a vaccine for COVID-19,"" said Dr. Davey Smith, a translational research virologist and head of the Division of Infectious Diseases and Global Public Health at University of California San Diego School of Medicine. ""A lot of people, including myself and colleagues at UC San Diego, are working very hard to develop one or more vaccines proven safe and effective. But that goal is months away. Right now, though, there is a readily available flu vaccine.""
First, some things to know and remember
Both influenza and COVID-19 can result in severe illness and death, though the latter has proven more deadly. The 2019-2020 flu season resulted in 39 to 56 million cases and an estimated 24,000 to 62,000 deaths. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) originally projected that the 2019-2020 flu season would be among the worst in recent history, but a late, sharp drop in cases ended the season six weeks earlier than normal.
The COVID-19 pandemic emerged as flu season closed. It continues, with at last count 6.3 million cases and 189,000 deaths in the United States; 27.4 million cases and 898,000 deaths worldwide since January.
Older adults, persons with certain underlying medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart problems, cancer, obesity and chronic kidney disease, are at highest risk for developing severe COVID-19 complications. Other suspected factors may be asthma, hypertension, HIV, liver disease, smoking and pregnancy. Young children appear to be at least risk for severe COVID-19 complications, with the exception of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, a rare but dangerous respiratory condition.
For the flu, unvaccinated young children are at higher risk of severe illness, as are adults age 65 and older, pregnant women and persons with underlying medical conditions, such as chronic heart disease, disorders of the kidneys, liver or blood, obesity or a weakened immune system.
Most people who contract COVID-19 or the flu recover fully in a few weeks. However, there are accounts of some seriously ill COVID-19 patients surviving, but then struggling with residual symptoms and effects lasting weeks or months.
""A small percentage of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) may develop scarring in the lungs that creates long-term lung problems,"" said Dr. Jess Mandel, chief of the Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine at UC San Diego Health. ""The vast majority do not have long-term lung problems. People may take several months to recover fully, but that is usually a consequence of being in an intensive care unit (ICU) for weeks, with loss of muscle mass and other issues. Most people with COVID-19 infections have some fatigue for a few weeks and then are back to normal.""
COVID-19 appears to attack other organs beyond the lungs, including kidneys and the heart. Dr. Eric Adler, cardiologist and director of Cardiac Transplant and Mechanical Circulatory Support at UC San Diego Health, said it's an evolving issue. A significant number of COVID-19 patients show signs of heart damage, he said, but it is not yet clear how often the damage is severe or long lasting. The risk of COVID-19-related heart damage appears greatest in older persons or those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease.
How do I know if I have the flu or COVID-19?
Dr. M. Monjur Alam, is a primary care physician at UC San Diego Health. He has seen and treated hundreds of patients with viral infections, of known and unknown origin.
For a patient with symptoms that might be flu or COVID-19, Alam said the first step is to inquire of any known exposures to the latter within the past 14 days and any travel history to or from an area where confirmed COVID-19 cases are high. He would ask too whether the patient has been vaccinated in the past for influenza or pneumonia.
COVID-19 and influenza have different incubation periods—the time between first exposure and onset of symptoms, if symptoms actually appear. (Up to 40% of infected persons carrying the coronavirus—and thus potentially spreading it—are asymptomatic.) The incubation period for COVID-19 is two to 14 days; for the flu, one to four days. (The common cold, which can be caused by other types of coronavirus, incubates one to three days, on average.)
""Both flu and COVID-19 cases can present with fever, shortness of breath, body ache, diarrhea, fatigue and other symptoms,"" said Alam. ""With the flu, patients can experience a rapidly rising, high-grade fever with shaking chills within the first couple of days. From a clinical standpoint, new-onset loss of smell or loss of taste, with or without other viral symptoms, would put COVID-19 on the top of my list of probable causes.""
At this point, experts say contracting the flu seems more likely than getting COVID-19. The CDC estimates that, on average, 8% of the U.S. population gets sick from the flu each season, with a historical range of 3 to 11%, depending on the season and the virulence of prevailing flu strains.
It is more difficult to measure the incidence of COVID-19, partly because it is a brand-new pathogen and partly because so many infected persons never display symptoms. Current estimates of cases and deaths are almost definitely undercounts. They do not include probable cases or cases not reported or diagnosed. CDC director Robert Redfield has estimated 10 additional infections for every reported COVID-19 case, which extrapolates to approximately 30 million cases or 10% of the U.S. population.
Incidence is uneven, however, with some regions of the country harder hit. The U.S. has reported roughly one-quarter of all COVID-19 cases worldwide, though it accounts for just 4% of global population.
Dr. David Pride, an infectious disease specialist and director of the molecular microbiology laboratory at UC San Diego Health, said test manufacturers are developing assays to detect and differentiate between flu and novel coronaviruses, though he said it's unlikely they will be widely available this season or ""game-changers.""
At UC San Diego Health, Pride said patients presenting symptoms that might be flu or COVID-19 may be tested for both illnesses, with results back within 24 hours. ""We expect demand for flu and COVID-19 testing to be high this flu season,"" he said. ""The one thing that can reduce the demand is continuing the current masking and social distancing practices. If people follow these practices, this could be one of the lightest flu seasons in a long time.""
What is standard of care for the flu and COVID-19?
For the flu, usual treatment is bed rest, plenty of fluids, perhaps over-the-counter medications for fever and body aches. Doctors may prescribe antiviral medications, such as Tamiflu, Relenza, Rapivab or Xofluza, for persons at heightened risk. These drugs shorten the duration of illness and help prevent complications.
""I highly encourage people to consult with their primary care physician so that they can receive timely medical advice, especially if symptoms are worsening after five to seven days,"" said Alam. ""I also advise patients to complete their annual influenza immunization and pneumonia vaccination if they are of certain age groups (65 and older) and if they have chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, kidney diseases, lung disease or an immunocompromised state.""
COVID-19 can look a lot like the flu—at least in the beginning. If symptoms are not serious, diagnosed patients are advised to quarantine at home, with treatment similar to flu infections. There are currently no proven COVID-19-specific home treatments, and no standard outpatient treatment. The CDC recommends patients self-isolate at least 10 days after symptoms appear.
""I would say the main difference between the flu and COVID-19 treatments is that we do routinely use antiviral medication for the flu, such as Tamiflu, but there is no standard treatment for COVID-19 at this time other than supportive care,"" said Dr. Michele Ritter, an infectious disease specialist at UC San Diego Health and director of its COVID-19 outpatient clinic. ""So the main issue is that it's important to know if someone has flu because it means they may get an actual antiviral treatment.""
For UC San Diego Health patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and recuperating at home, Ritter's team monitors them closely, with daily calls to assess progress and determine if worsening symptoms might require hospitalization.
Roughly 20% of persons with COVID-19 require hospitalization, with 5% of these patients in ICUs, perhaps requiring a mechanical ventilator to breathe.
There are few approved treatments specifically for COVID-19. Remdesivir, an investigational antiviral, has been shown to modestly reduce symptoms and shorten the duration of COVID-19 in some patients, and may be prescribed under an FDA emergency use authorization (EUA). Numerous clinical trials are on-going to assess its efficacy.
Dr. Amy Bellinghausen, a pulmonologist at UC San Diego Health, said dexamethasone, a corticosteroid commonly used to treat inflammatory conditions like arthritis, has shown promise in treating the sickest COVID-19 patients.
The FDA has also issued an EUA for convalescent plasma (CP) therapy, which involves infusing patients with antibodies extracted from the blood of donors who have successfully recovered from COVID-19, with the hope that the resulting boost to their immune systems will shorten the length and reduce the severity of the disease.
Evidence that CP therapy works is mixed, and a National Institutes of Health panel recently advised doctors to not treat CP as a standard of care until more research is done. Like remdesivir, clinical trials to test CP's safety and efficacy continue, including at UC San Diego Health.
Most COVID-19 treatment in hospitals, said Bellinghausen, is supportive, including supplemental oxygen and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. ""These interventions and others help keep the patient alive while the medication has time to work,"" Bellinghausen said.
Is it possible to get the flu and COVID-19 at the same time?
The answer is yes, maybe, probably not. SARS-CoV-2 and the flu are different viruses. They infect host cells using different methods; they behave differently within cells and inside the human body.
There have been documented cases of patients testing positive for both COVID-19 and seasonal influenza. Some early studies suggested co-infection was rare; later studies indicate it might be more common than previously thought.
""We simply don't know because COVID hit at the end of the flu season and then with all of the public health measures, transmission of all respiratory viruses went down,"" said Dr. Francesca Torriani, program director of Infection Prevention and Clinical Epidemiology and an infectious disease specialist at UC San Diego Health. ""What we can say is that the populations at risk for severe disease and death are the same, so you want to avoid an additional infection that can be mitigated by vaccination.""
Last, some things to know and do (they should sound familiar)
Wear a mask and save a life
Socially distance
Wash your hands frequently
These three basic acts of social responsibility and compassion fundamentally slow and reduce the spread and incidence of COVID-19. They work equally well against the flu and, in fact, are credited with shortening the 2019-2020 flu season earlier this year.
While the world waits for a scientifically validated vaccine for COVID-19, the flu vaccine for this season is already widely available. In most cases, the cost is covered by health insurance, nominal or free.
The CDC recommends everyone over the age of six months be vaccinated. Exceptions are children under the age of six months and persons with severe, life-threatening allergies to the flu vaccine or any of its ingredients, which might include gelatin or antibiotics. Such persons should consult a physician.
""We live in uncertain times,"" said Torriani. ""We don't know when a COVID-19 vaccine will become available or how much and how quickly it will help end this pandemic. But we do know a lot about flu vaccines, which have been around for almost a century.
""Every year's flu vaccine is different, formulated to anticipate the season's most likely strains of the virus. Their effectiveness can vary from year to year—influenza viruses are moving targets, always changing due to a genetic phenomenon called antigenic shift—but in most years they prove a good match against circulating strains. And even in mismatched years, they provide some protection.""
And right now, we need all the protection we can get.

The university is now disclosing its isolation and quarantine capacity, as percentages, though it is still withholding the actual number of isolation and quarantine beds and how many are occupied.
Ball State is also not reporting positivity rates, which an epidemiologist says ""gives us a little better indication of which direction we're going — up or down or leveling off.""
As of 4:53 p.m. Wednesday, the university estimated it had 71 active cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), down from 158 as of 3:28 p.m. on Monday. Sixty-seven of the active cases were students and four were employees.
BSU President Goeffrey S. Mearns wrote on Monday that relatively few faculty and staff have tested positive since students returned to campus, and that there were many more people on campus who recovered than who tested positive for the coronavirus last week.
He also wrote that BSU continues to maintain ample testing capacity; that the student health center staff is ""presently able to assist people who have mild symptoms;"" and that the school recently deployed extra employees to conduct contact tracing, resulting in the ability to ""very promptly notify 'close contacts' so that they can immediately quarantine.""
The latest version of the dashboard reported present isolation capacity of 97.2% and quarantine capacity of 95.9%.
""We presently have more than ample available capacity for isolation and quarantine,"" Mearns wrote, noting that in addition to hundreds of spaces in university-owned facilities, the school has secured hundreds of rooms in local hotels for extra quarantine space.
Indiana State University this week reported one infected student isolating on campus, 21 infected students isolating off campus, 16 students quarantining on campus and 90 quarantining off campus.
But isolation/quarantine is the only metric included on ISU's dashboard, which lacks, for example, positivity rates, which means the percentage of people who test positive for the virus of those overall who have been tested.
Isolation separates infected people, while quarantine separates and restricts people who were exposed to the disease to see if they become sick.
Indiana University's latest weekly COVID-19 briefing includes an update on utilization of quarantine and isolation housing, as a percentage. The most recent utilization rate of quarantine and isolation facilities available for students living in residential housing was 34% on the Bloomington campus.
The Purdue University dashboard on Friday reported only 52 of its 884 isolation and quarantine beds were occupied.
""I want to know what those numbers are,"" says Thomas J. Duszynski, the parent of an ISU student and the director of epidemiology education at IUPU, referring to quarantine and isolation statistics. ""As a parent, I'd like to know so I can understand whether the university has a handle on the outbreaks of these infections.
""Are they able to identify these students quickly; are they getting them in isolation; are they quarantining those who were exposed to these individuals? Without that, obviously, the numbers are going to grow. Now, obviously, it's a population that's least likely to die from this disease or have severe disease, but it doesn't mean it can't happen.
""If the numbers are always going up, are they missing something in that investigation, in contact tracing, or are students not doing the things they're supposed to be doing? If the numbers are going down or are level, you know they've got a handle on the situation.""
Ball State initially reported a running total of the number of COVID-19 tests and running total of the number of positive cases on its dashboard. As the fall semester progressed, it then added the number of people tested and positive cases in the past 24 hours, then added a weekly summary of the number of cases and an estimate of how many of those cases recovered.
MORE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:
►Could COVID-19 cancel trick-or-treating?
""The recovery numbers are important because we focus so much on the number of cases and we focus a lot on mortality,"" Duszynski said in an online interview. ""That's a horrible number and it's bigger than what I think it needs to be in the United States.""
""Mortality is a number we like to report because it demonstrates the severity of this illness. The recovery aspect helps us understand that the majority of the people who get this are going to recover, unless they have comorbid health conditions or immunocompromised conditions.
""Recovery is the bookend of the whole story. You have a lot of people getting sick and, unfortunately, a group dying from this disease, but we also have the other end, the people who are recovering. In most cases, everybody who has recovered has antibodies, but the challenge now is, does this prevent you from future infection? … You can get a different strain even after recovering from another strain.""
While the frequency of cases — one of the metrics Ball State is reporting — is great to know, frequency is influenced by the number of people tested, Duszynski noted. ""If we go looking for it, we're going to find more of it.
""So the numbers are great but it's the trends that make more sense to people. The positivity rate is something the average person can look at and see which way the disease is trending, up or down or leveling off or somewhere in the middle. We can see which direction the disease is going.""

185,https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-09-video-covid-vaccine.html,0.357,Video: Who should get a COVID-19 vaccine first?,"A committee of The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine is readying a report with recommendations for equitable distribution of a COVID-19 vaccine. In this Q&A, bioethicist Dr. Nicole Hassoun of Binghamton University breaks down the elements in the recently published draft report from the committee and explains the key questions around vaccine distribution.
Why is there a need for guidelines on how to distribute a COVID-19 vaccine?
It's clear that there won't be enough vaccines for everybody initially. It just takes a long time to get 300 million doses of vaccine made, and if we're looking at November as a potential date for a new vaccine, then people start thinking about, ""Well, what are we going to do when there's not enough?"" And that's where this proposal and others might fit in.
How does the National Academies' report approach this problem?
There are four phases to their distribution suggestions. First, they suggest giving the vaccine to high-risk workers and health care facilities and first responders. Then to people of all ages who have multiple medical conditions who are at higher risk for illness, as well as older adults who live in crowded settings like nursing homes.
The next thing they suggest is helping critical-care workers. That is, workers who are in jobs that are both really important for society and at high risk of exposure. For example, this would be teachers, school staff, people of all ages who have conditions that put them at higher risk, as well as older adults who didn't already get the vaccine. This phase also includes people at homeless shelters and prisons and other detention centers.
In phase 3, they would give the vaccine to young adults and children as well as people who are in industries essential to society that haven't already received it.
And finally, everyone in the U.S. would get a chance to have the vaccine if they haven't already gotten it.
Within each group, they will deploy the Social Deprivation Index, which comes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and looks at a variety of different kinds of deprivation, such as poverty or overcrowded housing. If you have a higher deprivation index or higher vulnerability index, then within that group, you'll get it first.
What's the rationale behind these phases?
The authors of the report say their first priority is to maximize social benefit by reducing death and disability and transmission rates. So at first they'll help try to prevent death and disability and then focus on constraining transmission. But they don't explain exactly what it means to reduce death and disability. I think they have to explain how to measure that. Instead, they shift to talking about different risk groups.
So they define people in different categories, like children and adults, but also describe different kinds of risks. They talk about the risk of acquiring infection, the risk of getting really sick or dying if you get COVID-19, the risk of negative social impact if individuals have a high-priority job, and the risk of transmitting disease to others. And then they rank everybody on these different categories and tell us who should get the vaccine first.
Is there an alternative approach to vaccine rationing?
I think what matters more than rationing is changing pharmaceutical incentives and rules for innovation. About 80% of pharmaceutical manufacturing is done on generics, which means there's a huge manufacturing capacity on the generic side of things, whereas only 20% is on patented medicines. If we let companies keep patents on those products, then they can charge what they want for those medicines or maybe they have advance purchase agreements with the government. But we can't use a lot of that manufacturing capacity, and so there'll be a lot less supply of the vaccine.
I think we can tie incentives to what I call global health impact, which encourages companies to focus on the biggest problems that cause the most death and disability. This goes well beyond the pandemic by using things like prize funds. So companies are rewarded for innovations based on the health impact of those innovations. Another example is the orphan drug tax credit, a tax incentive to develop cures for diseases that affect a relatively small group of people. Big pharma companies are some of the richest fortune 500 companies, and they say great profits are necessary for getting research and development done. But they don't make their costs transparent. Critics say they're over-inflated and that they include a lot of unethical marketing costs in the data that they provide.
At the minimum, I think companies should substantiate the claim that their profits are justified for the government to offer them the kind of patent protections that contribute to inequitable access.
What would be your approach to equitable vaccine distribution?
I think that if I had to decide how to distribute a vaccine, I would try to save the most lives and not the most life-years, which I think might be driving the National Academies' proposal. They want to maximize the greatest number of years lived across the population, as opposed to total number of lives. They put children in a higher risk group than I think is merited and maybe give the elderly less priority than I would. I think that arguments which focus on life-years aren't that great. For each person, their life matters so much to them, however long they might have left to live which I think is sufficient reason to treat that person equally.
I think a lot of things matter besides saving lives. The economic consequences of a pandemic, for instance, are really important. We have to know how to trade off lives against economic consequences to try to deal with that within a vaccine allocation system. I think there may be a tension between helping people go back to work, protecting the elderly, getting kids to school—but we can also use economic policies to address some of the economic problems. So I think a truly ethical proposal would treat every person equally and help countries get vaccines to people when they don't have the capacity to do that on their own.

186,https://www.al.com/coronavirus/2020/09/outbreak-alabama-a-funeral-directors-perspective.html,0.0,Outbreak Alabama: A funeral director’s perspective,"Today, we hear from Paul Rollins, a funeral director in Tuscaloosa who spoke at Tuesday’s Tuscaloosa Board of Education meeting, where the board eventually voted 5-3 in favor of reopening Tuscaloosa City Schools' plan to return to in-person instruction.
Elementary and middle students will start in a staggered format starting Sept. 21. High school students are scheduled to return in a staggered format Sept. 28. By October 12th, all traditional elementary, middle and high school students will return to their respective campuses, where Alabama Department of Public Health guidelines for operating schools will be followed.
Under the staggered model, half of the student body will be on campus for two days a week. The rotation will be on Monday and Tuesdays for one group, Wednesday and Thursdays for another group and Fridays will be a virtual day and planning day for educators. The time will be used to orient and train students on COVID-19 precautions, according to Tuscaloosa City Schools.
Students who signed up for full-year virtual learning will remain on that schedule, though students will have to visit campus for various services like state-required standardized tests. Read the full return plan here.
Paul Rollins, who has children who are not enrolled in Tuscaloosa City Schools, appeared to appeal to the board to resist sending kids back for in-person instruction. He sees it as too great a risk for the entire community, in the event that asymptomatic carriers then infect more vulnerable people in their households and beyond.
He also said his funeral home has seen about 30 people who have died from the virus, which has changed not only the way his business operates but also how family and friends mourn their loved ones and how the funeral home can help them cope with loss.
I spoke to Rollins about his concerns about COVID and children returning to school sooner than planned, if he thinks the board of education is truly taking his and other parents' remarks into consideration and how the pandemic has impacted his funeral home business.

The school found elevated amounts of Covid-19 in wastewater samples collected from four residence halls on campus.
Officials issued a safety alert on Sunday calling for mandatory testing and quarantine of all 287 students living in Rich, Jones, Morgan and Davis on-campus residence halls.
Classes started Monday at the school and some of the students had just moved into their rooms.
The mandatory quarantine is effective immediately and will continue until the test results are returned. USU also activated a Covid care team to arrange for resources to assist the affected students, including meal deliveries.
Wastewater sampling began July 1 and provides an early alert warning to address potential cases, said Amanda DeRito, a director with the university.
""The benefit of testing the water is that we get a snapshot into what is happening on campus and can quarantine even before a student becomes symptomatic. It is also less invasive,"" DeRito said.
No other testing samples on campus taken this week show elevated levels of the virus and there are currently no reported positive tests for Covid-19 in the quarantined residence halls, according to a university press release.
In mid-August, the CDC announced creation of the National Wastewater Surveillance System to help local public health leaders better understand the extent of the spread of the pandemic in their communities.
Sewage from house and workplaces can be tested for genetic material from the novel coronavirus. Studies show the virus can be found in feces from people who are sick and also from people who don't yet have Covid-19 symptoms.
Testing for all Americans a 'utopian' idea, administration official says
Adm. Brett Giroir, the Trump administration's coronavirus testing czar, on Tuesday dismissed the idea of daily Covid-19 tests for all Americans as ""utopian.""
""It's great to talk about this utopian kind of idea where everybody has a test every day and we can do that,"" Giroir said. ""I don't live in a utopian world. I live in the real world, and the real world had no tests for this new disease when this first started.""
The assistant secretary for health at the US Department of Health and Human Services said that the country now has a ""huge diversity"" of tests, including a $5 point of care test that provides results within 15 minutes.
""There is no stone unturned, there is no technology that we're not looking at or investing in if it's promising,"" Giroir said. ""We can return to society without having everyone have a test every single day. We can do that. We're showing we can do that.
""There may be a time where everybody can wake up in the morning, pass through a tricorder and tell whether they're infected or not,"" Giroir said, referring to the fictional handheld device from ""Star Trek"" that could scan people for data. ""We are not there yet.""
Testing availability and speed has improved in the US, particularly since the disastrous spring delays. Giroir said 91.9% of results from major referral labs, which do about half the tests in the US, were completed in three days. The mean turnaround time in August for large referral labs was 2.27 days.
Still, that 2.27-day average delay allows the virus to quietly spread, and public health and lab industry experts have repeatedly called on the federal government to take a larger leadership role in coordinating testing supplies.
US Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, the House majority whip, responded to Giroir's comments by saying, ""It would not be utopian if we had a national program to combat this pandemic. It may be going state by state. But one national program would not be utopian at all.""
CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen indicated that Giroir was attacking a straw man. Testing is an important part of public health strategy, but no one seriously argues testing can solve everything alone.
""He says, 'People say we can test our way out of the pandemic.' I have never heard anyone seriously say that,"" Cohen said. ""He needs to stop making up these boogie men who he's fighting against. No one is telling him we need a utopia. We're just telling him he needs to do better.""
Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, noted on Twitter that the White House staff has widespread testing, as do sports leagues such as the NFL.
""It's not utopia to want to test teachers & kids to return to school, nursing home residents to stay alive, first responders and other essential workers,"" he wrote. ""Sure, lets call it utopia when it's for the less privileged.""
Dire warnings for Iowa
A White House coronavirus task force report sent to officials in the state of Iowa this week warned of dire new case increases across rural and urban areas and called for a mask mandate, the closure of bars, and for university towns to do more as the pandemic intensifies in the Midwest.
CNN has obtained the nine-page August 30 report for the state, first reported by the Des Moines Register, from the Iowa Department of Public Health. The task force releases state-by-state reports each week to governors' offices, and has so far declined to make them publicly available.
The report says that Iowa is in the task force-defined ""red zone"" and warns that the state has the highest rate of cases in the US, which increased by 77.4% from the previous week.
Campus outbreaks
In the report, the task force points to universities as a major factor contributing to the virus's spread.
The three counties with the highest numbers of cases also have large student populations: Story County, home to Iowa State, and Johnson County, home to University of Iowa, as well as Polk County, which contains Iowa's largest metro area, Des Moines.
The university crossed the 1,000 active case mark on August 29 when it reported 302 cases in a single day. The overall current case load, including employees, is 1,026.
Other schools reported outbreaks.
At the University of South Carolina, 1,017 students currently have Covid-19, according to the university's coronavirus dashboard, making it one of the highest case counts recorded at a college so far.
Despite the climbing active case count and the fact that 60% of the university's designated quarantine space is in use, according to its dashboard, the school still lists its' alert level as ""low.""
The University of Missouri has 424 active student Covid-19 cases, according to the school's Covid-19 dashboard. James Madison University is reporting 138 new Covid-19 positive cases among its students and employees since Monday, according the JMU dashboard.
More than 20,000 cases of Covid-19 among students and staff have been reported at colleges and universities across at least 36 states, according to a CNN tally.
The campus reopenings represent new coronavirus hot spots in a country with plenty enough already as the US surpassed 6 million total confirmed cases on Monday.
NIH rejects plasma treatment
A National Institutes of Health panel said there's no evidence backing the use of convalescent plasma to treat coronavirus patients and that doctors should not treat it as a standard of care until more study has been done.
""There are insufficient data to recommend either for or against the use of convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19,"" the panel of more than three dozen experts said in a statement posted on the NIH website.
The statement, which was posted quietly, contradicts the Trump administration's characterization of the treatment as ""historic"" and a ""major advance"" and directly refers to last week's emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration.
Also Tuesday, an independent committee said any eventual coronavirus vaccine should go first to the people most at risk of catching it.
The draft report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine makes recommendations similar to those that have come from other groups, but it goes into detail to explain why health workers, for instance, should be among the first to get a vaccine."
189,https://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/2020/09/18/university-vermont-covid-19-testing-strategy-how-evolved-coronavirus/3477998001/,1.236,How UVM's COVID-19 testing strategy for students has evolved,"The University of Vermont will continue to test students weekly for COVID-19 until at least Nov. 1, President Suresh Garimella announced Wednesday.
UVM in July announced plans to test students for the coronavirus through Sept. 18, after which the initial phase of testing would undergo review through public health and medical analysis to guide future protocols.
Medical experts, who provided guidance based on the first month of testing, will review the data again with the university when this newest extension expires, Garimella said.
The university provides weekly updates on testing data for students, faculty and staff. The cumulative totals since Aug. 7, which include results received as of Wednesday, show:
Of 18,400 test results from off-campus students, eight tested positive.
Of 12,863 on-campus residential students, 11 tested positive.
No faculty (370) or staff (1,069) so far have tested positive.
10,700 undergraduate students, 26% of whom were Vermont residents.
1,627 graduate students, 41% of whom were Vermont residents.
478 medical students, 20% of whom were Vermont residents.
How UVM's response to COVID-19 evolved
Back in July, the university offered details for the on-campus and at-home options available to students.
Students who opted for the on-campus option were mandated ""to participate in twice-weekly sampling and testing for COVID-19,"" free and accessible on campus. This plan didn't appear to be in effect a month later, when Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger penned an Aug. 5 letter to Garimella.
Weinberger described the university's weekly publication of positive results ""unacceptable"" and advocated for daily updates. He also wondered why UVM opted only for weekly testing when ""in our previous conversations, and in written plans posted to your website"" the school indicated it would conduct testing two times a week.
The mayor announced in an Aug. 18 briefing updates on his conversation with Garimella that included clarifications and changes, such as the university's plan to share test results with the Department of Health daily and to keep Burlington in the loop ""on a standing weekly basis and more frequently if problems arise.""
UVM COVID-19 testing as it stands today
Students without exemptions could face administrative sanctions for missing a mandated test, UVM spokesperson Enrique Corredera wrote in an email to the Free Press Sunday.
""A second offense, or failure to test after the initial notice, would result in Center for Student Conduct review through the established hearing process for immediate suspension,"" he wrote.
Corredera indicated students appear to be following protocol based on the volume of tests being administered. However, The Vermont Cynic, an editorially-independent publication managed by UVM students, reported in a story with a Sept. 10 timestamp that results ""indicate that 3,427 fewer students were tested this week than last, despite University requirement that all students get tested weekly.""
Comparing the volume of results between website reports can present an inaccurate picture, Corredera explained in an email Thursday.
""That's because students are not necessarily testing on the same day of the week each week, so there are bound to be fluctuations from one report to the next,"" he wrote. ""We estimate we are getting about 99 percent compliance.""

190,https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/university-says-it-prevented-covid-outbreak-by-testing-students-feces/ar-BB18tzPn,-0.918,University says it prevented COVID outbreak by testing students' FECES,"Officials at the University of Arizona claim that they have prevented a COVID-19 outbreak by detecting the coronavirus in samples of feces taken from sewage produced by one of the on-campus dormitories.
When the test sample came back positive, university officials tested all 311 students and employees who live and work in one of the on-campus dorms.
They found that two of the students were asymptomatic positive and were quarantined, according to The Washington Post.
‘With this early detection, we jumped on it right away, tested those youngsters, and got them the appropriate isolation where they needed to be,’ former US Surgeon General Richard Carmona said.
Carmona has been hired to direct the task force in charge of safely bringing students back to campus.
Some 5,000 students are expected to return to the Tucson campus for move-in day this week. The university will be doing a mix of in-person and online classes to begin the fall semester.
As part of the school’s efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19, it said it would test the sewage water from all 20 on-campus student residences.
Other colleges like the University of California at San Diego and Syracuse University are doing the same.
On Tuesday, heath experts at the university found signs of the virus in wastewater from Likins Hall, one of the on-campus dorms.
All students living in the dorm were required to pass antigen tests before they were allowed to move in.
But it was after coronavirus traces turned up in the feces from the dorm that the two asymptomatic positive cases were discovered.
According to Carmona, without the sewage testing, the two students could have spread the virus without knowing it.
‘You think about if we had missed it, if we had waited until they became symptomatic and they stayed in that dorm for days, or a week, or the whole incubation period, how many other people would have been infected?’ he said.
Arizona was a national hotspot in late June and early July.
But it has since become a relative success story after cities and counties implemented mask measures and Governor Doug Ducey ordered bars, nightclubs and gyms to close.
Can coronavirus be spread by feces?
A study published in May 2020 in the Lancet found virus particles were present in feces of COVID-19 patients nearly 5 weeks after the patients tested negative.
These particles were still viable and could cause fecal-oral transmission of the coronavirus, the Chinese researchers warned.
Fecal–oral transmission has previously been seen in people with SARS and MERS.
Researchers say routine stool sample testing, as well as the existing throat swabs. should be used to make sure a person is clear of the virus.
Scientists also call for strict precautions to prevent transmission from the virus found in feces.
A new study shows the toilet lid should be put down before flushing to ensure infectious particles do not drift around the bathroom or cubicle.
Turbulence from the cascading water designed to remove fecal waste creates vortices which can carry infection droplets from stools up to 3 ft above the water level.
Up to 60 per cent of the ejected particles rise high above the rim and they can remain airborne for more than a minute.
The state Department of Health Services reported just 32 new cases on Thursday, the lowest total since May.
That brings the state pandemic total to 200,658.
Arizona reported just 33 new deaths on Thursday, bringing the overall toll to 4,932.
The university says it has detected 46 positive cases after administering antigen tests to more than 10,000 students.
Robert C. Robbins, the university president, expects COVID-19 cases to climb.
‘It’s inevitable,’ he said.
‘The issue is going to be can we handle the steady flow of cases or do we get a big spike in cases that overwhelms our ability to isolate and continue to test.’
Last week, Notre Dame and Michigan State universities became the latest colleges to move classes online because of the coronavirus as colleges struggle to contain outbreaks and students continue to congregate in large groups without masks or social distancing.
The decisions came the same day a third school in the 17-member University of North Carolina system - UNC at Chapel Hill - reported a COVID-19 cluster in off-campus housing.
The University of Oklahoma is requiring its sororities to recruit new members virtually after learning of students attending large social events without taking precautions against the virus.
Students at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville could face punishments as stiff as expulsion if they host big parties, if they won’t cooperate with COVID-19 contact tracing or if they don’t complete forms documenting their self-isolation, Chancellor Donde Plowman said in a video conference Tuesday.
Health experts in several countries, including the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, and Australia, have turned to lab-testing of feces samples in hopes of preventing outbreaks of COVID-19.
Scientists believe nationwide monitoring of sewage systems could be a good way to identify future disease hotspots before they manifest in infection numbers.
This could act as an early-warning system to prevent the need for local lockdowns.

Nearly half of school employees in high risk group for COVID-19, study says
While students may be in the group that poses the least risk for COVID-19 infection, a study says nearly half of school employees potentially have the highest risk.
According to a pre-print study to be published in Health Affairs, between 42% to about 51% of all school employees meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s definition for being at increased risk for COVID-19.
The CDC says that underlying health conditions, such as obesity, diabetes and heart disease, and older age put people into the highest risk groups.
The results align closely with a recent survey by the Education Week Research Center that said 43% of teachers have reported having a physical condition that makes them vulnerable to COVID-19.
USPS scrapped plan to send 650M masks to Americans, document reveals
A plan by the United States Postal Service to send 650 million masks to Americans at the start of the pandemic was scrapped, according to a document obtained by the watchdog group American Oversight through the Freedom of Information Act.
The announcement, which was first reported by the Washington Post on Friday, was drafted but never sent. USPS said in the plan that first shipments of masks were expected to reach U.S. households at an unspecified date in April.
The document demonstrates how the Postal Service’s role in the pandemic response may have been more involved than initially reported this spring.
Nearly half of US public say they wouldn’t get a COVID-19 vaccine: Pew study
Even after government agencies and pharmaceutical companies pledged their independence in the race to find a vaccine for the coronavirus, Americans are still divided over whether they would get vaccinated.
According to a Pew Research Center survey, nearly half of U.S. adults (49%) say they definitely or probably would not get vaccinated at this time. Intent to get a COVID-19 vaccine has fallen by 21% since May.
While intent to get a vaccinated has declined across all major political and demographic groups, some differences remain. Just 32% of Black adults say they would definitely get a vaccine compared with 52% of white adults, 56% of Hispanics and 72% of Asian Americans.
The national survey was conducted Sept. 8-13 among more than 10,000 U.S. adults.

Las Vegas bars, taprooms, breweries will be allowed to reopen on Sunday
After a six-month shutdown due to COVID-19, Nevada officials announced bars, taprooms and breweries can reopen Sunday night in Clark County, where Las Vegas is located. Nevada's COVID-19 Mitigation and Management Task Force on Thursday unanimously approved the county's plan to reopen drinking businesses throughout the Las Vegas Valley.
Clark County Commission Chairwoman Marilyn Kirkpatrick told the task force that bar owners are committed to following health and safety protocols. State biostatistician Kyra Morgan revealed the COVID-19 positivity rate dropped from 8.6% to 7.8% between Monday and Thursday. The World Health Organization's recommends that rate should be no higher than 5%.

Utah governor considers statewide mask mandate amid COVID-19 surge
Utah Gov. Gary Herbert said Thursday he is considering a statewide mask mandate and planning expanded coronavirus testing in response to what he called an alarming spike of infections in the state.
The state counted 911 new confirmed cases on Thursday, a new record for any single day. The rolling average of daily new cases has increased by about 54% over the past two weeks, according to state data, and has jumped to 661 per day this week compared to 381 per day last week.
“We are taking this spike and the magnitude of it very seriously,” Herbert told reporters.
Herbert, a Republican, has urged residents to wear masks for months but has stopped short of implementing a statewide mandate. He has instead allowed counties to decide if they needed bans.

India's coronavirus case count increases by 96K over 24 hours
India’s coronavirus cases jumped by another 96,424 infections in the past 24 hours, showing little sign of leveling.
The Health Ministry on Friday raised the nation’s total past 5.21 million, or about 0.37% of its nearly 1.4 billion people. It said 1,174 more people died in the past 24 hours, for a total of 84,372 fatalities, but experts say India's death toll may be a significant undercount.
India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his birthday on Thursday made a fresh appeal to people to wear masks and maintain social distance as his government chalked out plans to handle big congregations expected during a major Hindu festival season beginning next month.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott relaxes limit restrictions on businesses; bars must stay closed
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Thursday that he would allow businesses to expand pandemic limits on capacity in most of the state, citing a decline in coronavirus hospitalizations.
The order allows businesses operating at 50% capacity to move to 75% starting Monday. That includes restaurants, retail, office buildings, manufacturing, gyms, libraries and museums. Bars remain closed under the order, although some have been able to reopen by selling more food than alcohol.
“Without vaccines available, containing COVID is a challenge, but Texans have already shown that they are up to that challenge,” Abbott said at a Capitol news conference. “As we go about the process to continue to contain COVID, we will also continue to work to open up Texas.”
And Abbott is allowing hospitals in much of the state to resume elective surgeries, effective immediately. Nursing homes and other long-term care facilities may resume visitations next Thursday, as long as there are no outbreaks at those facilities.

Survey: 751 Arizona teachers have resigned or retired since school began
There are fewer teachers than ever in Arizona classrooms, according to a new survey from the Arizona School Personnel Administrators Association.
Just a few weeks into the school year, about 28% of teacher positions in the state remained vacant compared with 21% vacant last year, the data shows, which means about 3 in 10 classrooms are not led by a qualified teacher. Schools have had to fill those open positions with long-term substitute teachers or others without teaching qualifications.
Teachers across the state have said COVID-19 adds to the pressure to quit, especially when faced with the threat of returning to the classroom amid the pandemic. Some medically vulnerable teachers are particularly worried about contracting the virus while around students. Arizona school districts had about 6,145 open positions this year — 1,728 remain vacant, compared with 1,443 in 2019.

Moderna says vaccine trial results could come in November
Moderna, one of the companies leading the effort to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, announced Thursday it could have enough clinical trial results as soon as November to confirm the effectiveness of its candidate vaccine.
Results of the vaccine’s effectiveness will be presented to an independent review committee after 53 people in the trial contract COVID-19, and again after 106 and 151 infections. Half the participants are getting a placebo and half the active vaccine, called mRNA-1273.
Statistically, if the vaccine is effective 75% of the time, it should take only 106 infections in both groups to prove its effectiveness, Dr. Jacqueline Miller, Moderna’s senior vice president of infectious disease development, told company investors on Thursday. At that point, which will likely come in November, Moderna could apply for an emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to begin distributing the vaccine.
The FDA has said a vaccine must be at least 50% effective to win federal approval, but the companies developing vaccines have said they are aiming for at least 60% and hopefully even higher effectiveness. Moderna had originally predicted that it might take until May 2021 to prove its vaccine’s effectiveness, but pushed up that timeline because participants joined quickly, the COVID-19 infection rate remained high around trial sites and the company was able to start the trial earlier than originally expected.

The testing site will be built on UCH’s Aberdeen property, along Route 22 near the I-95 exit, where it eventually plans to build a free-standing medical facility that will replace Harford Memorial Hospital in Havre de Grace. The work is expected to be completed in the next six to nine days and be opening for testing by Oct. 1, according to the email.
The structure comes in response to the state’s mandate that vehicle emissions testing sites — which were being used as temporary coronavirus test sites — revert to testing cars by October, the email states.
Vickie Bands, director of community outreach and health improvement for UCH, said the state is also interested in in site as a template to possibly roll out indoor testing across the state. The temporary indoor testing site will use negative air pressure to minimize risks for coronavirus exposure, according to the email.
At Upper Chesapeake Medical Center in Bel Air, COVID-19 patients have been treated in negative pressure rooms, which allow hospitals to regulate the flow of air into and out of a COVID patient’s room and avoid contamination throughout the rest of the hospital.
Bands said the temporary structure will require a new process. UCH has drive-through testing “down to a science,"" she said, but inviting people into an enclosed room comes with precautions.
Only six people will be tested in the building at any one time, Bands said. Masks will be required and social distancing will be observed. Those seeking tests will have to wait outside the building — which Bands likened to a temporary office on a construction site — until they receive a text message telling them to come inside.
The impetus for moving testing indoors, Bands said, is the draining nature of testing outdoors. While the heat was rough on staff this summer, the winter cold is another challenge.
Anyone can make an appointment to be tested at the new site, even without a doctor’s note or insurance. The Aberdeen site will be open from 10 a.m. to noon on Mondays, 8 a.m to noon on Wednesday, 3 to 7 p.m. on Thursdays and 10 a.m. to noon on Fridays.
Testing is free for people without insurance, and there is no fee for people with insurance, although insurance will be charged.
Generally, COVID-tests have been outdoors, often without making those seeking tests leave their cars, because of the virus' easier transmission in indoor spaces. According to the email, a temporary structure could also smoothly pivot to become a vaccination site when a vaccine becomes available.
The tests done at the site will be sent to either LabCorp or the University of Maryland Medical System Lab, if someone is getting a pre-surgical test. Turnaround times for test results are expected to be between 24 and 48 hours. Bands said LabCorp generally gets test results back after roughly two days.
The types of tests will vary based on the availability of swabs; they can either be nose or cheek tests, the email states.
According to the email, UCH has also prioritized testing of emergency workers, giving the example of sheriff’s deputy who needs to be cleared before returning to work.
UCH has conducted a number of testing initiatives — including a one-day drive-through test collection at Ripken Stadium in August. More than 700 people were tested at the site, according to Molly Mraz, a spokesperson for the Harford County Health Department.
Many COVID and flu symptoms are similar to each other, and Harford County’s former health officer, Russell Moy, and infectious disease expert at UCH Faheem Younus have urged county residents to get vaccinated for the flu to ward off a potential conjunction of the sickness and coronavirus.
UCH will have a free, drive-through flu vaccination clinic on Tuesday, Sept. 29, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the Forest Hill VEIP station for people ages 12 and older. No appointment is needed.

UNH Chief of Police Paul Dean and Health and Wellness Medical Director Peter Degnan alerted that the Gables apartments were named as an outbreak site in a Wednesday evening email to students, faculty, staff and community members. The designation came after consulting with the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services.
Since Aug. 31, the school’s first day of classes, 20 positive cases of the coronavirus have traced back to the Gables. All positive cases were asked to isolate immediately for 10 days, while anyone in close contact with the positive cases were asked to quarantine for 14 days.
Per the university’s COVID-19 webpage, “a close contact is defined as any individual who was within 6 feet of an infected person for at least 10 to 15 minutes starting from 2 days before illness onset (or, for asymptomatic patients, 2 days prior to positive specimen collection) until the time the patient is isolated.”
The Gables, a five-building, on-campus apartment complex, houses approximately 1,000 students. The email stated the amount of positive cases traced back to the Gables since Aug. 31 has since been cut to 10 active cases.
UNH reported Thursday it had 37 active coronavirus cases (27 students and 10 faculty and staff members) as of Wednesday. Of the 143 students asked to quarantine as a result of contact tracing and testing, 24 are quarantining on campus. From Sept. 10-16, UNH found 19 positive cases in its community, a 0.08% positivity rate among the 22,962 COVID-19 tests performed.
Senior Caitlin Durnbaugh is a second-year community assistant in the Gables. She serves on a team of students tasked with enforcing UNH policy and procedure while helping create a positive environment for the residents. Despite the outbreak at the Gables, she feels their ability to enforce COVID-19 regulations has been “really good.”
Durnbaugh said she and her co-workers sometimes have to ask people to wear a face mask or wear one properly above their nose, but “so far, people have been really receptive to that.”
She said she and her co-workers have received complaints about noise violations, but that doesn’t always equate to parties in the complex. She noted a lot of Gables’ students, with a growing desire to stay home, will play music with their windows down, so people might perceive the Gables party scene to be worse than it really is.
“So I would say things like that are in our control, but also may seem like it’s out of our control, because perception, at the end of the day, is really becoming reality,” she said.
Chief Dean and Degnan reassured the school is taking proper precautions with residents of the Gables. Their email stated: “enhanced education and outreach has been undertaken at the Gables and residents have been reminded to continue to avoid group gatherings. Following normal protocols any living space where a positive case is identified undergoes a deep cleaning.”
UNH’s first designated COVID-19 cluster was within Theta Chi fraternity, which came under fire from the university after a gathering of approximately 100 students on Aug. 29 led to at least 11 COVID-19 cases. Theta Chi was placed under interim suspension, with UNH President James Dean Jr. saying the fraternity’s actions were “reprehensible and will not be tolerated.”
Gables Manager Kelsey Gilmore and UNH spokesperson Erika Mantz did not immediately respond to request for comments for this story.

Charles M Schweik, University of Massachusetts Amherst and Timothy Ford, University of Massachusetts Lowell
(THE CONVERSATION) An international, multi-billion-dollar race is underway to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, and progress is moving at record speed, but with nationalistic,competitive undertones. If and when an effective vaccine is invented, its production will require an unprecedented effort to vaccinate people across the globe.
However, for the country that invents a safe and effective vaccine, at least in the urgent short term, it will be politically difficult to export vaccines before their own population is immunized. “The only solution,” vaccine development scientist Sandy Douglas told The New York Times, “is to make a hell of a lot of vaccine in a lot of different places.” But how?
Having the public sector fund contracts with vaccine makers is a key component to meeting this future, unprecedented, distribution challenge. But in the United States, there seem to be some disturbing trends.
We are faculty affiliated with two University of Massachusetts campuses. Ford studies environmental microbiology and infectious disease and is former director of the Institute of Global Health at UMass Amherst. Schweik studies how humanity can leverage the internet to collaborate and share innovations toward solving pressing societal problems. COVID-19 is such a problem.
Public sector vaccine R&D contracting
Early-stage vaccine R&D often relies on substantial public sector investment, and this is certainly the case for COVID-19. There are at least 26 vaccines undergoing human trials, nine of which are in Phase 3. If results demonstrate safety and effectiveness, regulators will approve a vaccine license that will allow the organization that invented it to begin manufacturing and distribution.
In the United States, there are many firms with active COVID-19 vaccine R&D contracts financed with large sums of taxpayer money. For example, the company Moderna, which has a vaccine in Phase 3 trials, has received a contract valued at approximately US$955 million. Contracts like these typically fall under the jurisdiction of the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, a law that grants the inventing firm exclusive license over the product patent. But this law also provides safeguards – “march-in rights” – that allows the federal government to withdraw the exclusivity license if the patented invention is not made available to the public under “reasonable terms.”
Overpricing – essentially asking taxpayers to pay twice for the vaccine, once supporting research and development and then again for purchasing the actual vaccine – would be an example of a situation where march-in rights could apply. In that scenario, the federal government could revoke the exclusive rights from the inventing firm and grant new licenses to other companies to proceed with manufacturing and distribution.
There is, however, an alternative mechanism called “Other Transaction Agreements” (OTA) that allows federal agencies to enter into legally binding R&D contracts which fall outside of the standard types overseen by Bayh-Dole provisions. OTA-based contracts, therefore, are exempt from the “march-in” safety provisions established by Bayh-Dole. Several current vaccine and other COVID-19-related R&D contracts fall under OTAs.
In these cases, U.S. government agencies made an explicit choice to arrange OTAs with these companies. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies receiving funds could potentially charge unreasonably high prices for their COVID-19 treatment or vaccine, and the U.S. Federal Government has no “march-in” recourse to revoke the exclusive license to sell the taxpayer-funded vaccine.
Under OTAs, America’s large financial investments in COVID-19 vaccine development could allow firms control over how their inventions are sold, manufactured and distributed. But to be fair, at least one company – Johnson & Johnson – who received an OTA contract has publicly stated: “We have from the beginning decided we are going to do this not for profit so that the vaccine becomes affordable and available on a global scale as quickly as possible.”
Open sharing of innovations: A case from the industrial revolution
But if society needs to rapidly invent and deliver a vaccine – a global public good – with taxpayer money, why are U.S. federal agencies establishing OTAs that relinquish the government’s ability to share and deploy these inventions and production processes with the world?
We believe that as the U.S. federal government considers future funding to support vaccine manufacturing, policymakers and agency officials need to craft contracts with the suppliers that mandate open sharing of all vaccine production, quality control and distribution.
Schweik has studied open source software that comes with an associated copyright license that promotes free and broad sharing. This licensing dates back to the mid-1980s. The invention of the “General Public License,” sometimes referred to as a viral or reciprocal license, meant that should an improvement be made, the new software version automatically inherits the same license as its parent. We believe that in a time of a global pandemic, a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine should be licensed with General Public License-like properties.
It turns out, in the early days of the Industrial Revolution, in an effort to rapidly develop standardized small arms parts, the U.S. Army and the Springfield Massachusetts Armory gave contractors open access to designs of new manufacturing equipment with the explicit requirement that if they improved the machines or processes related to them, they had to share these innovations with the national armories and their rival contractors. If these organizations did not comply, they would likely be denied future contractual opportunities. In essence, the armory established a contracting policy similar to General Public License invented roughly 150 years later, which then led to rapid innovation.
A pandemic requires open source sharing
Fortunately, some pharmaceutical companies, national governments, nonprofits like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and international organizations like the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Initiatives – which supports vaccine development – are putting policies in place that embrace openness and sharing rather than intellectual property protection.
Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Initiatives officials have stated that all of their funding agreements require that “appropriate vaccines are first available to populations when and where they are needed to end an outbreak or curtail an epidemic, regardless of ability to pay.” That’s an important start.
However, when there is a safe, effective COVID-19 vaccine, the U.S. and other national governments need to create contractual agreements with firms that provide fair and reasonable funding to cover their costs or even some reasonable profit margin while still mandating the open sharing of the processes for vaccine production, quality assurance and rapid global distribution.
[Deep knowledge, daily. Sign up for The Conversation’s newsletter.]
Of course, rapid global distribution is only the initial goal. To be sustainable, a critical mass of developing country vaccine manufacturers will be necessary, together with a support system for these manufacturers that provides regulatory guidance and access to new formulations.
The longer-term goal must be to build sustainable vaccine manufacturing capacity within low- and middle-income countries. This requires a support system leveraged through the WHO and associated organizations such as Gavi to provide regulatory guidance and access to new formulations through this open source process.

It’s One More Threat to Voting by Mail.,"This article was first published in ProPublica, a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom.

For months, one postal worker had been doing all she could to protect herself from COVID-19. She wore a mask long before it was required at her plant in St. Paul, Minnesota. She avoided the lunch room, where she saw little social distancing, and ate in her car.
The stakes felt especially high. Her husband, a postal worker in the same facility, was at high risk because his immune system is compromised by a condition unrelated to the coronavirus. And the 20-year veteran of the U.S. Postal Service knew that her job, operating a machine that sorts mail by ZIP code, would be vital to processing the flood of mail-in ballots expected this fall.
By mid-August, more than 20 workers in her building had tested positive for the coronavirus. Then, in a list of talking points on her supervisor’s desk, she spotted a reference to a new positive case at the plant. She had heard that someone she’d worked with closely a few days earlier was out sick, but no one at USPS had told her to quarantine, and no contact tracer had reached out to her. Although USPS’ protocol is to tell workers when they’ve been exposed to COVID-19, that didn’t happen, she and another postal worker familiar with the case said.
Asking around, she learned that a colleague she’d partnered with to load mail into the sorting machine had been infected. She phoned her doctor, who advised her to quarantine and get tested. Later that week, she tested positive and began suffering body aches, a sore throat and fatigue.
“They should’ve told anybody who worked with him, ‘You need to go home.’ What is it going to take, somebody to die in the building before they take it seriously?” said the worker, who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation.
In recent weeks, furors over Postmaster General Louis DeJoy’s cost-cutting initiatives, and over President Donald Trump’s unsubstantiated warnings of voter fraud, have overshadowed a significant threat to the Postal Service’s ability to handle the expected tens of millions of mail-in ballots this fall: a rapid rise in the number of workers sidelined by COVID-19.
The total number of postal workers testing positive has more than tripled from about 3,100 cases in June to 9,600 in September, and at least 83 postal workers have died from complications of COVID-19, according to USPS. Moreover, internal USPS data shows that about 52,700 of the agency’s 630,000 employees, or more than 8%, have taken time off at some point during the pandemic because they were sick, or had to quarantine or care for family members.
High rates of absence could slow ballot delivery in key states, especially if there’s a second wave of the coronavirus, as some epidemiologists predict. Twenty-eight states, including Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Florida, require mail-in ballots to arrive by Election Day to be counted.
Even in a normal year, absentee levels of this magnitude “would have a dramatic effect on the mission of the postal service,” said Alan Kessler, an attorney who served on the Postal Service’s Board of Governors during the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, including as chairman from 2008 to 2011. “When people ask me about November, my biggest concern right now is exactly that — the on-time delivery of mail.” Kessler is a former finance vice chair of the Democratic National Committee.
What vacant positions have been filled at USPS have been filled by less experienced temporary workers. Restrictions on overtime pay under DeJoy may have prevented full-time workers at some facilities from adding hours to pick up some of the slack. While USPS has nearly $14 billion in cash, it reserves some of that funding to pre-pay employee pensions, and it is projected to run out of money next spring. On Thursday, a federal judge in Washington state temporarily halted operational changes that have slowed mail delivery, finding that “at the heart of DeJoy’s and the Postal Service’s actions is voter disenfranchisement.”
As the St. Paul worker’s case illustrates, the Postal Service’s half-hearted precautions against COVID-19 have contributed to the problem. Its efforts to limit the virus’s spread in the workplace fall short of recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Unlike Amazon, which relies on USPS to help deliver its packages, the Postal Service doesn’t test workers or check their temperatures, depending instead on self-reporting. When employees get sick, USPS sometimes neglects to tell co-workers, and its efforts at contact tracing have been inconsistent and understaffed.
Reflecting these shortcomings, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration has received more than 250 coronavirus-related complaints against the Postal Service since March, more than twice the number filed against private employers in the same industry like Amazon, FedEx and the UPS. Amazon, which has almost 250,000 more workers than the postal service, had 117 complaints. The complaints against USPS paint a worrisome picture. They typically allege failures to maintain social distancing, enforce mask wearing or inform workers when colleagues have the virus.
The tally doesn’t include open complaints yet to be made public, including one by another worker in the same St. Paul building. That July complaint, obtained by ProPublica, accused USPS of “not communicating and informing employees that may have potentially been exposed to positive COVID-19 employees,” as well as inadequate ventilation and six other hazards. The Postal Service responded to OSHA that it traces contacts of all employees who test positive and encourages ailing employees to stay home. Nevertheless, OSHA told the complainant that it will inspect the facility as soon as possible.
The Postal Service has been adamant that it can handle a nationwide increase in voting by mail in the general election. Even a mass shift to mail-in ballots would represent a small portion of its overall volume.
Still, DeJoy, a major donor to President Donald Trump and the Republican Party, acknowledged in congressional testimony last month that COVID-19-related absences had upended mail service. “Across the country, our employee availability is down 3 to 4% on average,” DeJoy said. “But the issue is in some of the hot spots in the country, areas like Philadelphia and Detroit — there’s probably 20 [other areas] the averages cover — they could be down 20%. And that is contributing to the delivery problem that we’re having.”
The Postal Service referred us to an April 30 statement on its website. Its COVID-19 leadership team “is focusing on employee and customer safety in conjunction with operational and business continuity during this unprecedented epidemic,” according to the statement. “We continue to follow the strategies and measures recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and public health departments.”
Among its initiatives, the statement said, the Postal Service is supplying its more than 30,000 locations with masks, gloves and cleaning supplies. Employees who can’t maintain social distance must wear masks. The service has reduced employee contact with the public by eliminating a rule that customers must sign mobile devices for deliveries, and it has updated its leave policy to allow workers to take extra time off for illness and child care.
Postal workers who test positive are supposed to tell their supervisor, who should alert a nurse responsible for contact tracing. But communication is sometimes lacking. “They have the occupational nurse doing the contact tracing, but sometimes there’s no contact with the worker. And some managers don’t report [the case] to the tracking. Some managers tell people, ‘You don’t sound sick, come to work,’” said Omar Gonzalez, western regional coordinator at the American Postal Worker Union. “So we don’t really know what to rely on.”
One reason that the system breaks down is a shortage of contact tracers. USPS, which does not provide medical care to workers, employs about 160 nurses. Alongside other administrative duties, they are supposed to register COVID-19 cases and interview workers when they get sick. In the New York district, one nurse has been responsible for contact tracing for about 8,200 employees; in Detroit, the ratio is two nurses per 11,600 workers; and in Atlanta, one for 12,500. Facilities in all three districts have seen coronavirus outbreaks. USPS has reemployed 10 former agency nurses to assist with contact tracing, according to a spokesperson.
“To use the word contact tracing is a joke,” said Jonathan Smith, president of the New York metro area’s postal worker union.
Coronavirus outbreaks in several areas have correlated with slower delivery times. First-class delivery has slowed since March, with notable lags in New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia, Detroit, Chicago, Houston and Southern California, according to data from GrayHair Software, which tracks postal analytics.
COVID-19 has “caused severe disruptions to on-time delivery in many parts of the country,” the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs reported this week. In late March and early April, it found a spike in cases in Michigan, “especially in the Detroit area,” led to a “notable drop in on-time delivery.”
In Philadelphia, where more than 235 postal workers have tested positive, local media outlets reported unsorted mail piling up in postal facilities and carriers unable to complete routes even after working extra hours. Some residents said they went two to three weeks without receiving mail. In April, COVID-19-related delays in Detroit facilities slowed delivery of primary ballots for parts of northwest Ohio, prompting Ohio’s secretary of state to call for in-state processing of all ballots. In Michigan’s August primary election, more than 6,400 residents’ votes weren’t counted because they arrived after the deadline, though it’s not clear whether COVID-19 was a major factor.
Internal USPS data from its southern region in mid-August shows the impact of the coronavirus on workers. In Atlanta, more than 900 postal workers had been infected with COVID-19 or had to quarantine. More than 550 workers were affected in Houston and an additional 485 in South Florida.
COVID-19 outbreaks have strained postal offices that had inadequate staffing even before the pandemic, said Michael Caref, national business agent of the Illinois chapter of the National Association of Letter Carriers. “Now you’re seeing crisis levels in some areas.”
In March, the Postal Service donated 500,000 N95 masks “in excess of our needs” for distribution to hospitals and other critical workers, according to a draft letter from the Board of Governors to members of Congress that was made public by American Oversight. However, the service doesn’t provide N95 masks, which are considered especially effective at filtering out virus particles, to most of its own employees. A Postal Service spokesperson said USPS supplies N95 masks to employees who require them. Other workers receive surgical masks.
The CDC and OSHA have both released guidance on how employers should protect workers, though it does not carry the power of law. According to the CDC, “businesses and employers can prevent and slow the spread of COVID-19 within the workplace.”
The CDC advises employers to “consider conducting daily in-person or virtual health checks (e.g., symptom and/or temperature screening) of employees before they enter the facility.” The Postal Service doesn’t conduct those checks. The onus falls on workers to stay home if they notice symptoms, get tested, report back on results and recall whom they were in contact with.
At Amazon, which has also been criticized for failing to protect its employees during the pandemic, precautions are more stringent. According to an Amazon spokesperson, the company does daily temperature checks and has installed thermal cameras at some of its sites. When an employee is exposed, the company “immediately kicks-off contact tracing to determine if anyone was exposed to that individual, and we inform those employees right away and ask them to quarantine for 14 days with pay,” the spokesperson said.
FedEx’s protections also appear more robust than the Postal Service’s. FedEx checks temperatures of employees at some of its sites, and it has expanded testing to 43 locations since July, according to a company spokesperson.
The CDC advises employers to collaborate with local and state health departments on contact tracing. According to its guidance, employees who are asymptomatic but have been within about 6 feet of a person with COVID-19 for a prolonged period of time should self-isolate and quarantine for 14 days. Often, contact tracing is needed to identify those employees.
But even when USPS employees report positive tests, supervisors don’t always follow through. In August, an asymptomatic employee in Flint, Michigan, tested positive for COVID-19 and told a supervisor as well as a few co-workers. The worker stopped coming in, but the supervisor didn’t inform USPS’ medical unit until four days later — after the exposed workers had told their union, which in turn reported the case to management. Michael Mize, the local postal union president, said he pushed the supervisor to report it. A USPS nurse started contact tracing on the fifth day.
“That’s way too slow,” said George Rutherford, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California at San Francisco School of Medicine.
Because most people infected with COVID-19 often begin shedding large amounts of virus four or five days after they’re exposed, even if they’re asymptomatic, co-workers in Flint might have transmitted the disease before the nurse contacted them, Rutherford said. “That’s why you gotta get on this stuff quickly.” According to CDC guidance, exposed co-workers should be contacted and tested within 24 hours.
USPS and union officials had a Zoom call to discuss what went wrong in Flint, Mize said. “Luckily we don’t have any major outbreaks because of any failures that happened,” he said. “If things aren’t handled appropriately, you’re relying on good fortune.”
Roscoe Woods, a Detroit-area postal union president, said that USPS sometimes lacks up-to-date contact information, complicating the task of contact tracers. In addition, employees often don’t know the surnames of exposed co-workers. “You’re trying to trace down eight people and all their contact information is bad,” said Woods, who has stepped in to help with contact tracing in the past.
When employees are sidelined because of the coronavirus, USPS can fill in some of the gaps by hiring employees who aren’t in the union. But the Postal Service has long had trouble hiring and retaining temporary or non-career employees, and union representatives say the Postal Service has been slow to fill these roles during the pandemic.
In February, the Postal Service’s Office of Inspector General faulted the agency for failing to recruit and retain nonunion workers. In 2019, the annual turnover rate for non-career employees, who constitute 21% of the workforce, was 38.5%; the average tenure for workers who left their jobs was just 81 days. One of the top reasons for leaving: Workers said that supervisors didn’t treat them with respect. The jobs filled by these workers are physically strenuous, pay about $17 an hour, lack benefits and often require an inconsistent work schedule. It can take weeks to hire and train them.
“The hiring process is really slow,” Caref said. “And if you have a person that says they want to work, the person is not prepared for a month after they’ve been hired. They really need to figure that out.”
Virus-related OSHA complaints from around the country reflect some of the dangers and frustrations postal workers have faced throughout the pandemic.
“The station and the vehicles have not been cleaned and sanitized. Bleach spray bottles were provided at one time but the employees were not provided material to wipe down surfaces and the bottles have since broken,” reads a complaint filed from Houston on June 18. “Employees in the vehicles do not have hand sanitizer or another method to cleanse hands while away from the station.”
In a postal facility in Smithtown, New York, “the air conditioning has not been working properly for the last 3-4 weeks (blowing 81 degrees at the vent) which has made working in the building uncomfortable and may be contributing to employees not wanting to [wear] their masks,” a complaint stated in mid-July. It’s unclear what action, if any, OSHA took on the Houston and Smithtown complaints, which are now closed.
Since the worker in St. Paul began quarantining in mid-August, there have been at least 11 COVID-19 cases at her workplace, according to Postal Service emails obtained by ProPublica. Overall, at least 33 out of more than 1,000 workers have tested positive at the building since the start of the pandemic.
In USPS’ Northland District, which covers Minnesota — including the St. Paul plant — and western Wisconsin, at least 148 workers have tested positive. “We had a record breaking day with COVID-19 positive cases today. 18 employees must be quarantined. This is not a good record,” reads an Aug. 25 email from USPS management to unions regarding the Northland District.
“We had 4 new COVID-19 cases reported today. Things aren’t getting any better,” management said in an email two days later.
No one replaced the St. Paul postal worker while she was out. She returned to the job this month, even though she was still recovering and low on energy, because she needed the money. After two weeks of sick leave, her days off were unpaid, and her husband hasn’t worked for four months because of an unrelated health condition. Plus, the situation at the plant has improved somewhat: Social distancing has become mandatory in the break rooms, and employees were warned that not wearing masks could jeopardize their jobs.
She also felt a civic obligation, because she’ll be responsible for processing thousands of ballots in the upcoming election.
“That’s another reason why I want to go back to work,” she said. “I want to make sure the ballots get run.”

Johnson County continues to have the most confirmed cases in Kansas with 10,178. Sedgwick County is the county with the second most cases with 8,270. Wyandotte County is third with 6,739 cases.
Leavenworth County – home to Lansing Correctional Facility – has 1,924 cases, and Douglas County now reports 1,889. The Douglas County case count is largely tied to increases at the University of Kansas.
Health officials said the median age of people with COVID-19 is 35, and they are monitoring 191 (+0) active outbreak clusters.
9 a.m. -- A gathering at the Lake of the Ozarks is bringing tens of thousands of motorcycle enthusiasts to Missouri, generating worry that the state’s already fast-growing number of coronavirus cases could spike even higher.
Bikefest Lake of the Ozarks drew about 125,000 people last year. The event, which began Wednesday, bills itself as the largest motorcycle rally in the Midwest. It includes five days of rides, vendor fairs, concerts and stops at area bars and restaurants, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.
Missouri lifted pandemic restrictions on June 16, at a time when the state had a little over 16,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19. In the three months since then, the total has grown to 106,587. As of Wednesday, 1,739 Missourians have died. Missouri has no statewide mask requirement nor capacity limitations, though several local governments have implemented their own restrictions.
The White House Coronavirus Task Force has raised concerns about Missouri. The task force recommended that bars be closed and dining restricted in Missouri counties marked as “yellow” or “red” zones - meaning they have moderate to high levels of virus transmission. Camden and Miller counties, where Bikefest is taking place, are both in red zones, according the task force letter.
Messages left Thursday with Bikefest organizers and a spokeswoman for Republican Gov. Mike Parson were not immediately returned.
Last month, similar concerns were raised before the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, which brought nearly 500,000 motorcyclists to South Dakota. The rally is seen as a big reason why infections have since surged in North Dakota and South Dakota, along with the return to schools and universities.
Missouri ranks near the top of all states for new cases per capita. Hospitalizations are rising, too. Three of the four highest days for hospitalizations have occurred since last week, according to data from the Missouri Hospital Association.
Camden County reported 186 new coronavirus cases -- a 35% increase -- over the past two weeks, according to the University of Missouri’s tracking site. Miller County reported a 49% increase with 123 new cases; and nearby Morgan County saw an 82% increase with 99 new cases.
Steve Edwards, chief executive of Springfield-based CoxHealth, which operates several hospitals and health clinics in southern Missouri, said he is worried that Bikefest will increase cases both locally and wherever participants return home.
“These events tend to draw many people into crowded spaces. It’s especially worrisome if participants gather indoors at bars and restaurants which have proven to be high-risk areas,” Edwards said. “It is reckless.”
7:45 a.m.-- Kansas’ health department has suspended its reporting on individual businesses and other locations where clusters of coronavirus cases have occurred after only a week. The agency says it wants to make sure the data does not include cases that aren’t current. READ MORE
7:30 a.m. -- Johnson County reported Friday morning 9,879 (+139) cases of COVID-19 since the outbreak started. The county said it has 7,145 presumed recoveries and 141 (+1) people have died since the start of the outbreak.
It also has tested 117,490 people with 110,507 negative tests for an overall positive test rate of 8.4%. The county said it has tested 195.0 people per 1,000 in the county.
As of Friday morning, the school reopening gating criteria – the 14-day rolling total used by the county to make recommendations on how schools should reopen – slid slightly to 12.1%. The gating criteria also listed 120.4 cases per 100,000 people in the county over the last seven days and the new cases trend is decreasing, per the county.
The county said it is monitoring 15 outbreaks at senior living care facilities. It also said that 94 people from senior living care facilities have died, which is 67.14% of the deaths in Johnson County.
Johnson County health officials lost access to hospital bed utilization in June and have not reported those numbers since June 19.

12:30 p.m. -- Clinton High School announced Thursday afternoon that its Friday night game against Pleasant Hill has been canceled due to COVID-19 concerns. The junior varsity game against Pleasant Hill next Monday has also been canceled.
Noon -- Just two weeks after students started returning to Ball State University last month, the surrounding county had become Indiana’s coronavirus epicenter.
Out of nearly 600 students tested for the virus, more than half have been positive. Dozens of infections have been blamed on off-campus parties, prompting university officials to admonish students.
University President Geoffrey Mearns wrote that the cases apparently were tied not to classrooms or dormitories but to “poor personal choices some students are making, primarily off campus.”
""The actions of these students are putting our planned on-campus instruction and activities at risk,” he said.
Similar examples abound in other college towns across the nation. Among the 50 large U.S. counties with the highest percentages of student residents, 20 have consistently reported higher rates of new virus cases than their states have since Sept. 1, according to an Associated Press analysis.
On average, infection rates in those 20 counties have been more than three times higher than their states’ overall rates.
At James Madison University in Virginia, which recently sent students home through September amid a surge in cases, the county is averaging a weekly infection rate of nearly 90 cases per 100,000 people, or more than eight times the statewide average.
Health officials fear that surges among college students will spread to more vulnerable people - older ones and those with underlying health problems - and trigger a new wave of cases and hospitalizations. Some worry that colleges could overwhelm hospitals already bracing for increasing cases of COVID-19 and flu this fall and winter.
“There’s this waiting game. Does it stay on college campuses or will it escape?” said Dr. Jeff Pothof, chief quality officer at the University of Wisconsin medical center in Madison, where cases among college students have been climbing.
While universities have emerged as hot spots in nearly every state, many of the worst outbreaks have been scattered across the South and Midwest. Of the 50 college counties analyzed by the AP, James Madison’s had the highest infection rate, followed by counties that are home to the University of Georgia, Florida State and Indiana University in Bloomington.
In the 10 counties with the highest infection rates, colleges have reported at least 15,000 cases among students and employees in recent weeks, though testing and reporting practices vary significantly and the actual number is probably much higher.
For many colleges, the return to campus was a carefully orchestrated process that took months to plan and millions of dollars to pull off. But as safe as they’ve made their campuses, many colleges have struggled to curb off-campus gatherings that have been tied to thousands of infections.
Parties were blamed for dozens of cases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which brought students back in early August only to send them home weeks later.
Other schools have cracked down on parties and disciplined students. The University of Missouri in Columbia announced this week that it expelled two students and suspended three others for violating rules meant to slow the virus’s spread.
The outbreaks are increasingly straining relations between universities and their towns.
Amid a spike in cases at the University of Colorado at Boulder, county health authorities Tuesday urged all students to quarantine for two weeks. Students and others at the university have accounted for 76% of the county's 663 positive cases over the past two weeks, officials said.
“More stringent and mandatory restrictions will be imposed if students do not comply and break the transmission cycle,” Jeffrey Zayach, executive director of Boulder County Public Health, warned in a letter to students.
In a letter to students, the school's chancellor, Philip DiStefano, warned that the quarantine will be strictly enforced and that students who violate it could face suspension or other discipline. Already, DiStefano said, more than 400 students face university discipline for violating public health orders.
At Miami University in Ohio, county health authorities ordered all of the school's athletes to isolate for 14 days last month after 27 tested positive for the virus. Last week, local police cited six men at an off-campus house party that included several students who had recently tested positive.
As cases increase at Boston College and the campus runs out of quarantine space, the mayor of nearby Newton is asking the school not to use any of the town's hotels or other property to isolate students.
Some cities have tightened rules at bars to discourage students from gathering. As cases surged at Illinois State, the town’s mayor issued an order requiring all bar customers to be seated to be served. He also limited gatherings near campus to no more than 10 people.
Still, residents and officials in many college towns are rooting for universities to work through outbreaks and avoid campus closings that could further hurt the local economy.
Fred Pryce, who manages a series of stores in a strip mall near Ball State, said sending students home would hurt the area’s businesses “big time.”
“That’s 20,000-plus potential patrons that will vanish,” Pryce said. “There are ways to keep students in Muncie safely while they do their classes.”
11:30 a.m. -- Two of Missouri's largest sports arenas will be used as polling places in November, election officials said.
Arrowhead Stadium, home of the Kansas City Chiefs, will be a polling place on Nov. 3. In Columbia, some voters will be able to cast their ballots at Mizzou Arena.
Athletes across the county have led efforts to increase voter registration and promote the importance of voting as part of the response to social justice issues raised since the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis.
Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and safety Tyrann Mathieu have led voter registration drives and the Chiefs organization has posted videos on social media encouraging people to vote.
Missouri athletes have held marches and rallies that included messages urging people to vote. On Wednesday, the basketball team released a video featuring players Mitchell Smith and Dru Smith saying they will push to have the entire team register to vote this year.
Basketball coach Cuonzo Martin said on Twitter it was vital that everyone has a chance to vote.
“We’re thankful to be able to open the doors of our home and commit to making sure the Columbia community has that opportunity,” he said.
11:15 a.m. -- The Kansas City, Missouri, Health Department has reached out to 10 people urging them to self-quarantine after they may have been exposed to COVID-19 at the Chiefs’ home opener last week. The department said an individual who attended the game and watched from a group’s box in Arrowhead Stadium last Thursday tested positive for the coronavirus the very next day. READ MORE
9 a.m. -- Kansas officials are considering spending $50 million to dramatically ramp up testing of people who aren't showing obvious signs of the coronavirus.
A state task force this week backed Kansas Health Secretary Lee Norman’s recommendation to use the federal stimulus money on testing at schools, workplaces and other sites. The goal is to catch coronavirus in people who haven’t even realized they’re carrying it, KCUR reports.
Some of the testing would be done at Wichita State University, where a new not-for-profit lab is gearing up to churn out hundreds of thousands of tests by the end of the year.
“I know that sounds like a lot,” said Tonya Witherspoon, Wichita State’s vice president of industry engagement, “but we think several labs in the state need to be able to do that much - or more.”
Kansas has so far focused most of its energy on people who know either that they are ill or that they have had direct exposure to a confirmed outbreak. But experts say positivity rates should drop when a state or city goes beyond testing these groups of people who are most likely to be sick.
Right now, about 15% of Kansans who get the test find out they have COVID-19. By Johns Hopkins University’s calculations, that puts it among the states with the highest rates of new positives.
On Wednesday, Kansas health officials reported 971 new cases since Monday, for a total of 50,870 across the state. Kansas also had 52 new deaths, raising that number to 586 since the pandemic began.
Norman said at a news conference that 37 of the new deaths were added through a review of death certificates. But that still meant 15 had occurred since Monday, a higher than normal number.
“We are getting to a very sensitive point in time as we talked about during Labor Day with universities, colleges and schools starting back again, athletics those sorts of things,” Norman said. “People are starting to mass gather again in ways that we didn’t see as much of over the summer when people were more dispersed out. As the overall number count goes up, we are going to have more deaths.”
The positive cases include 841 at the University of Kansas, where house parties near campus are raising alarms.
After a debate during the Lawrence City Commission meeting Tuesday, a majority of the commissioners said they were interested in at least considering an ordinance that would make it a municipal offense to violate local health orders designed to stem the spread of the coronavirus, the Lawrence Journal-World reports.
City Attorney Toni Wheeler said the offense would be a misdemeanor that could be prosecuted in municipal court. Violators could face a fine of no more than $500, up to 30 days in jail or both.
However, Vice Mayor Brad Finkeldei and Mayor Jennifer Ananda said they were not sure that creating a municipal ordinance would be the best approach, and that perhaps stronger disciplinary action from the university, such as bans from campus, mandatory quarantines or suspensions, would be more effective.
Meanwhile, Gov. Laura Kelly hosted a discussion with rural hospital administrators on Wednesday where she urged them to “exert pressure” on lawmakers to support a proposal to expand Medicaid in Kansas.
In the discussion, Harold Courtois, CEO for the Memorial Health System in Abilene, said his organization is worried about running out of personal protective equipment, particularly medical N95 respirators, known as N95 masks, ahead of the flu season.
“My fear is that during the influenza season, where everybody appears to have COVID -- whether it’s influenza or not -- PPE is going to become scarce and be very difficult to acquire again,” Courtois said. “It just doesn’t seem like we see a lot of PPE unless you’re willing to pay enormous prices. There’s still price gouging going on every week”

WEDNESDAY5 p.m. -- The number of new coronavirus cases remains high in Missouri, but Gov. Mike Parson on Wednesday cited the state's declining death rate as evidence that progress is being made.
Parson, speaking at a news conference, noted that in the early days of the pandemic in April and May, more than 7% of all cases were fatal. That percentage has gradually dropped and so far this month, just 0.3% of Missourians infected with the COVID-19 virus have died.
“This is all very encouraging and we continue to monitor this data each and every day,” Parson, a Republican, said.
Still, the number of confirmed cases has risen dramatically since the state reopened for business in mid-June. Missouri reported 1,191 new cases on Tuesday, bringing the total to 106,587 since counting began in March. Seven more deaths also were reported. All told, 1,739 Missourians have died from COVID-19.
Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services Director Randall Williams said about 60% of new cases are occurring in areas outside of the state’s metropolitan areas. He said many of the places seeing spikes are mid-sized cities such as Joplin and Cape Girardeau.
“We really need to concentrate on these middle-sized communities,” Williams said.
Parson also cited as reason for optimism what he called “stable” hospitalization totals. But the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that three of the four highest days for hospitalizations have occurred over the past week.
Data shows 1,021 patients in hospitals with confirmed or presumed COVID-19 on Saturday, the second-highest day on record. The highest was Sept. 9, when 1,040 patients were hospitalized. The fourth-highest number of hospitalizations on record occurred Friday, with 1,008 patients.
4:30 p.m. -- New details are coming to light after the Kansas City, Missouri, Health Department shut down the Westport Ale House.

2:45 p.m. -- The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services reported 1,191 new cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday, bringing the statewide total to 106,587 since the start of the outbreak.
There have now been 1,739 deaths across Missouri from COVID-19, which is up seven from Monday’s total.
Health officials said 989 (-32) patients have been hospitalized due to COVID-19. Due to a change in data measures and the reporting platform issued by the White House on July 13, data on hospitalization reflects a 72-hour delay.
Missouri does not list how many people have recovered from COVID-19.

The state said it has tested a total of 1,164,383 people through PCR testing – a test that looks for the virus in the nose, throat or other areas of the respiratory tract to determine if there is an active infection – and 8.9% of those were positive. The seven-day percent positive of PCR tested individuals is 12.2%
The state said it has tested 71,668 people through serology testing – a test that looks for antibodies in the blood – and 4.5% of those were positive.
The DHSS reports 10,232 (-18) confirmed COVID-19 cases in Kansas City, Missouri, while Jackson County now has 6,695 (+86) cases since the outbreak started. Health officials said there have been 100 (+1) deaths in Kansas City, and Jackson County reports 77 (+0) total.
The state also lists 1,657 (+15) total cases in Clay County (outside of Kansas City), 1,302 (+14) in Cass County and 586 (+3) in Platte County.
2:30 p.m. -- The Kansas Department of Health and Environment said its reported spike of 52 deaths related to COVID-19 on Wednesday is attributed to “in part to reconciliation of death certificates.”
“In addition to deaths reported in our disease surveillance system, we also have deaths we learn about when we receive death certificates,” a spokesperson with KDHE said. “We review our death registration system on an ongoing basis and the increase we have seen this week is a result of that review. It also incorporates deaths over a period of time – not ones that have occurred specifically between Monday and today.”
1:30 p.m. -- The Kansas Department of Health and Environment said Wednesday it's rethinking how it's going to release the locations of active clusters of COVID-19. Last week, KDHE released the locations of active clusters throughout the state for the first time. READ MORE

11:16 a.m. -- Lawrence officials are looking for ways to put the brakes on house parties in neighborhoods near the University of Kansas campus as the number of positive COVID-19 cases among students continues to rise.
After a debate during the Lawrence City Commission meeting Tuesday, a majority of the commissioners said they were interested in at least considering an ordinance that would make it a municipal offense to violate local health orders designed to stem the spread of the coronavirus.
The Lawrence Journal-World reports that the discussion came as the the University of Kansas announced Tuesday that the total number of COVID-19 cases has risen to 841, an increase of 42 cases since Friday.
10:19 a.m. -- All students at the University of Colorado's main campus are being told to self-quarantine starting Wednesday for the next two weeks to stem an alarming rise in coronavirus cases.
The advisory by Jeffrey J. Zayach, executive director of Boulder County Public Health, came in a letter Zayach sent Tuesday to Boulder campus students, faculty and staff. Zayach warned mandatory restrictions could follow if students do not comply.
University officials have reported 13 positive tests the first week of school, 90 the second week and 205 the third week. Most cases involve students who live off-campus.
Students were asked to stay at home with a few exceptions that include attending class or going to work.
Dr. Rachel Herlihy, the state epidemiologist, said Tuesday there have been six COVID outbreaks at Colorado colleges and universities.
9:43 a.m. -- Hospitalizations for the coronavirus have risen in recent days across Missouri, according to data from the state health department.
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that three of the four highest days for hospitalizations have occurred over the past week.
The most recent data shows 1,021 patients in hospitals with confirmed or presumed COVID-19 on Saturday, the second-highest day on record. The highest was Sept. 9, when 1,040 patients were hospitalized. The fourth-highest number of hospitalizations on record occurred Friday, with 1,008 patients.
The number of confirmed cases has risen dramatically since the state reopened for business in mid-June.

All told, 1,732 Missourians have died from COVID-19.
9 a.m. -- Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft on Tuesday announced he's handing out 25,000 three-ply, disposable face masks to local election workers to help slow the spread of the coronavirus.
Voters on Nov. 3 will head to the polls to pick the president, Missouri governor and state and federal lawmakers.
7:30 a.m. -- Johnson County reported Wednesday morning 9,615 (+70) cases of COVID-19 since the outbreak started. The county said it has 6,888 presumed recoveries and 138 (+0) people have died since the start of the outbreak.
It also has tested 115,113 people with 108,276 negative tests for an overall positive test rate of 8.4%. The county said it has tested 191.1 people per 1,000 in the county.
As of Wednesday morning, the school reopening gating criteria – the 14-day rolling total used by the county to make recommendations on how schools should reopen – rose slightly to 12.1%. The gating criteria also listed 110.6 cases per 100,000 people in the county over the last seven days and the new cases trend is decreasing, per the county.
The county said it is monitoring 14 outbreaks at senior living care facilities. It also said that 93 people from senior living care facilities have died, which is 67.3% of the deaths in Johnson County.
Johnson County health officials lost access to hospital bed utilization in June and have not reported those numbers since June 19.
7:20 a.m. -- Leading St. Louis-area doctors are warning residents to brace for at least another year of living with COVID-19.
The region, covering portions of both Missouri and Illinois, has surpassed 1,500 COVID-19 deaths and more than 54,000 confirmed cases since the first positive test in March. St. Louis Public Radio reports that while doctors say they've become better at treating the virus and preventing its spread, life won't likely return to a pre-pandemic “normal” until late 2021 at the earliest, echoing comments made last week by Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
Dr. Alex Garza, who leads the St. Louis Metropolitan Pandemic Task Force, said that despite the persistent number of confirmed cases, the region is in a “better position” now than early on in the pandemic because more is understood about slowing the spread.
Garza noted that the percentage of sick people who die is lower than in early spring. Early in the pandemic, outbreaks were happening in nursing homes, meat plants and other crowded spaces.
Steps such as requiring masks in those places, restricting visitors and increased testing have helped, Garza said.
7:15 a.m. -- Wyandotte County is reporting Wednesday morning 6,400 (-1) confirmed cases of COVID-19 since the outbreak started, with 34 patients currently hospitalized and 141 probable cases. The county said 133 (+5) people have died from the coronavirus since the start of the outbreak.
The county updated its dashboard two weeks ago to indicate it will no longer release the number of people recovered.
The dashboard also updated two weeks ago to indicate which ZIP codes have the most recent cases. Over a 14-day period the 66102 ZIP had 73 cases, followed by 66109 with 61 cases and 66104 with 50.
Wyandotte County does not list hospital capacity numbers on its dashboard.
7 a.m. -- The state of Kansas isn’t officially listing the number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, but local health departments across the state are keeping track. According to numbers from Wednesday morning, there have been 36,687 people who have recovered from the coronavirus. This includes 6,888 in Johnson County, 4,876 in Wyandotte County, 1,695 in Leavenworth County and 1,171 in Douglas County.

Gov. Mike DeWine unveiled the Ohio Department of Health COVID-19 school district dashboard during his press conference on Thursday. The dashboard is the result of an ODH order from earlier this month requiring schools to report cases to their county health department within 24 hours of learning of about them.
The dashboard will track cases of COVID-19 in all public and private K-12 schools across the state. Data displayed on the board includes all student and staff cases broken into two categories: new and cumulative. The board will be updated each Thursday.
Northeastern and Graham Local School District were the only two districts in Clark and Champaign County who recorded a positive case between Sept. 7- 13.
Northeastern had previously announced the district’s case on Sept. 2 and in a press release said it was found within Rolling Hills Elementary School.
According to a letter posted on Graham’s website, the district confirmed its positive COVID-19 case on Sept. 11, although they did not specify which school.
DeWine reiterated on Thursday that just because a school has positive tests does not mean they are not following health protocols. He said what happens in schools is a reflection of what happens in the larger community.
In good news for the “larger community”, Clark County remained at a level 2 on the Ohio Public Health Advisory System for the fourth straight week, bucking DeWine and Clark County Combined Health District Commissioner Charles Patterson’s prediction the county would likely move to level 3 this week.
DeWine and Patterson said last week they expected the county to move to the red level because of an outbreak at Wittenberg University.
ExploreCoronavirus: Wittenberg president tells DeWine how university is handling outbreak
Wittenberg, located in Springfield, recorded a total of 55 active cases on Thursday, according to their website. The university reported 104 resolved cases, with a total of 163 cases to date.
Clark County has frequently bounced between level 2 and level 3 since Gov. Mike DeWine unveiled the advisory system on July 2. The first time the county hit level 3 was on July 2. The first time the county hit level 3 was on July 23. The county then dropped back to level 2 for a couple of weeks before moving back to level 3 on Aug. 20.
Since then, the county has remained at level 2.
Champaign County jumped to level 2 this week after being a level 1 for two weeks. The county made the swing to level 2 after seeing an increase in cases over the past two weeks, from 12 to 20.
The advisory system ranges from level 1 or yellow as lowest to level 4 or purple as highest and most severe. No county has received a purple rating.
The seven indicators the Ohio Department of Health uses when judging what level to give a county are: new cases per capita, sustained increase in new cases, proportion of cases not in a congregate spread, sustained increase in emergency department visits for COVID-like illness, sustained increase in outpatient visits for COVID-like illness, sustained increase in new COVID hospital admissions and intensive care unit bed occupancy.
Last week, Clark County hit two indicators: new cases per capita and sustained increase in new cases. This week the county hit the same two.
Clark County had 1,693 cases, 37 deaths and two probable deaths of the coronavirus as of Thursday afternoon, according to ODH. Champaign had 283 cases and three deaths.
Statewide, 11 counties were given a level 3 rating this week, including Montgomery County.
In addition to the school dashboard, DeWine also unveiled a second COVID-19 data dashboard on children.
The children’s dashboard shows how many Ohioans younger than 18 have tested positive for the virus, as well as hospitalizations and deaths. It also breaks down cases by county, age group, ethnicity and race.
Of Clark County’s 1,693 cases, 129 were children under the age of 18, according to the data.
Ohio reported 141,484 total cases and 4,580 deaths of the coronavirus on Thursday, according to ODH. Between Wednesday and Thursday, the state reported 1,067 new cases and 25 new deaths.

202,https://www.wxyz.com/news/coronavirus/what-information-is-available-about-covid-19-in-michigan-schools,0.558,What information is available about COVID-19 in Michigan schools?,"LANSING, Mich. (WXYZ) — If you are a parent or teacher, do you have the right to know if there is a COVID-19 outbreak in your child’s school? What information can you find or learn?
7 Action News took a look at what information will be available at the local, county, and state levels.
At the local level, there are varied policies. School districts decide what to communicate with students and staff. Some schools may only notify those known to be in close contact with someone sick, perhaps in a shared class. Many may notify more to prevent rumors and unnecessary fear.
“School districts should be saying right now what their policies are going to be,” said Doug Pratt, MEA Director of Public Affairs.
The Michigan Education Association says teachers in some districts are concerned about a lack of transparency when it comes to what will be shared. They are calling for every school board to publish what it will be communicating and how so leaders are accountable to the public.
Counties have been sharing data on how many COVID cases there are, case rates, the demographics, and zip codes of the sick on their health department websites.
Most don’t specifically address school outbreaks.
“The defining factor for us on sharing public information is whether we can reach people individually that we determine are most at risk,” said Susan Ringler Cerniglia, MPH, the Public Information Officer at the Washtenaw County Health Department.
She says they do it this way to protect privacy and prevent unnecessary fear. The health departments will be working closely with schools whenever there is a case of COVID-19 in a district. It will also be providing contact tracers to contact people potentially impacted.
“If there were some sort of an event at a school, or associated with a school, where there might have been broad exposure, then the health department would share that,” she said.
“It is a fine line between being transparent and giving people information to make decisions and then providing too much information to overwhelm people,” said Kayleigh Blaney, and Epidemiologist with the Oakland County Health Department.
Blaney says the health department focuses on information that helps assess risk. To help with that when it comes to schools since schools are a microcosm of their community, Oakland County has created a map of COVID-19 case rates in school district boundaries.
“It is very important to look holistically at everyone in that community that is a case of Covid and look at it by district,” said Blaney.
On the state’s COVID-19 dashboard it lists the number of current school-related outbreaks by region. It does not provide details on whether they are in an elementary, secondary, or college level school.
Some have asked whether the state will provide a list of schools impacted, similar to the lists provided on cases in nursing homes. Proponents say it allows the public to look for patterns. Do certain school policies lead to more cases? Opponents say it could leave people miscalculating risk, without greater perspective and information.
WXYZ reached out to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to find out where things stand in the state’s plan to expand the information provided on COVID-19 in schools.
“MDHHS is dedicated to providing COVID-19 data to Michiganders that is timely and accurate. We are working on a process to collect more detailed information on school outbreaks in the coming weeks and will report this information once it is validated,” we were told in a statement.

Medical Officer of Health Dr. Vera Etches confirmed Friday that Ottawa is in a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic
“It’s the speed of the increase that concerns us.”
“We want to flatten it, keep it a small bump,” said Etches
Ottawa Public Health reported 63 new cases of COVID-19 Friday, bringing the total of active cases across the city to 458
There are 11 people in hospital, none of them in ICU. There have been 3,486 cases and 273 deaths locally
Ottawa is offering a number of facilities to use as COVID-19 testing sites, says Mayor Jim Watson
Mayor calls for a “pivot” in messaging to keep asymptomatic people away from the long lineups.
The mayor said the new sites are being finalized but expects they will be announced next week.
The mayor said the primary responsibility for testing is with the hospital network and they’re stepping up.
Three pop-up testing sites were set up Friday, but Ontario Health two were deployed to schools “with known prevalence.”
They asked the public not to attend the pop-ups “as they have a limited capacity and are focused on targeting the school population.”
The west end care clinic on Moodie Drive closed its line at around 9 a.m., shortly after opening, after hitting its daily capacity
Dr. Robert Cushman, acting medical officer of health with Renfrew County and District Health Unit, says universal testing for COVID-19 has led to major problems and advocated “strategic testing”
He said the broader testing has led to problems such as expired samples and test results that take upwards of seven days to get back
“It’s bad science to do universal testing, but it’s good politics,” he says.
Dr. David Williams, Ontario’s chief medical officer of health, also criticized the slow turnaround times in Ottawa
He said the city labs, which are overseen by the Ottawa Hospital, are dealing with “logistical issues they’re trying to work through.”
Dr. Howard Njoo, deputy chief public health officer, said Friday it was too soon to declare the country was experiencing a “second wave” of COVID-19 infections, but “the trend is definitely going the wrong way.”
As expected, Public Safety Minister Bill Blair announced Friday that the Canada-U.S. border will remain closed to non-essential travel until Oct. 21.
Health Canada was reporting a total of 140,887 cases of COVID-19 since the pandemic began. There are 8,558 cases nationwide.
Premier Doug Ford said he’s hopeful that by this time next week, “we’ll have numerous pharmacies … helping out the system.”
“We can’t work at government speed, we have to work at COVID speed.”
Ford also noted that the new private gathering limits applied in Ottawa, Toronto and Peel (up to 10 people indoors and 25 outside) will be rolling out in other areas of the province, on the request of local mayors and medical officers of health.
Ontario’s daily COVID-19 new case count was 401 on Friday
No new COVID-19 deaths were reported in Ontario
The Outaouais will be one of eight Quebec regions getting extra attention during a second weekend crackdown to ensure venues and patrons are obeying provincial regulations
Quebec reported 297 new cases of COVID-19 and one additional death on Friday.
Medical Officer of Health Dr. Vera Etches confirmed Friday that Ottawa is in a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, in response to a question from CTV Ottawa at a Friday media scrum.
“We’re seeing a rise in cases and it’s the speed of the increase that concerns us.”
Etches says the second wave of COVID-19 now washing over the city can be stopped if people take responsible action today.
“The actions we take today could make that wave flatten, that curve flatten in the next two to three weeks,” Dr. Vera Etches told reporters in a news conference Friday afternoon.
“That’s what I hope: that this is another peak that will not last longer than the next two weeks. And it is up to each of us to make that happen.”
Etches said she expects that the city’s COVID-19 numbers will rise and fall in a series of peaks and valleys. She declared that a second wave is underway, Etches explained, because the number of positive cases is rising rapidly, and at the same time, the percentage of people testing positive is on the rise – even as the number of people tested also increases.
“These are the signs that there is more COVID in our community,” she said. “The challenge comes when that growth is too rapid and when it’s sustained.”
Such a second wave, she said, threatens to invade long term care homes and cause more hospitalizations and more deaths unless it is brought under control.
“Our goal as a community is to stop the rise, slow down the rise, turn the curve again,” she said.
Etches explained that “second wave” doesn’t have to mean transmission of the virus reaches crisis levels. In fact, Ottawa already went through a small wave of increased transmission in July, she said.
“We want to flatten it, keep it a small bump,” said Etches.
Ottawa Public Health reported 63 new cases of COVID-19 Friday, bringing the total number of active cases across the city to 458.
That includes 11 people in hospital, none of them in ICU. Since the beginning of the pandemic, 3,486 COVID-19 cases and 273 deaths have been confirmed locally.
There are now 23 ongoing outbreaks of the virus in local institutions, an increase of two in the last day. The new outbreaks are at a Wee Watch West home child-care centre and Garderie Tunney’s Daycare and involve one case in a child and one case in a staff member, respectively.
Ottawa is offering a number of facilities to use as COVID-19 testing sites , says Mayor Jim Watson, who told Premier Doug Ford on Friday that there needs to be a “pivot” in messaging to keep asymptomatic people away from the long lineups.
“Everyone is stretched to the limit (and) we still need facilities more geographically spread out,” Watson said in an interview.
The mayor said the new sites are being finalized but expects they will be announced next week.
“We don’t run the testing system but if we can be helpful by providing these facilities free of charge, then we’ll do that,” Watson said
Brewer Arena is the city’s main COVID-19 assessment centre and in recent days has seen families start lining up in the early hours to try to guarantee tests before closing time. Other testing sites on Moodie Drive and Heron Road have also been swamped.
Watson said he’s been told by health officials that up to 90 per cent of people in the lines have no symptoms.
Watson said Ottawa Public Health has stepped up to help, but the primary responsibility for testing is with the hospital network.
“To their credit now, and I’ve talked to all four hospital presidents, they understand the urgency and frustration and they have to get this problem fixed.”
While the city remains in an emergency situation, Watson said there’s no need for logistical assistance from the military as there are no additional sites yet to set up testing facilities.
Meanwhile, two schools in Ottawa will be visited by mobile COVID-19 testing sites this weekend, with tests made available only for staff and students with symptoms or those at the school who’ve been identified as high-risk contacts of a confirmed case and haven’t yet been tested.
One of the pop-up sites appears to be Collège catholique Franco-Ouest, a French Catholic high school in Nepean where the province has reported three cases of COVID-19 among students.
The second site, for staff and students at De La Salle High School, has been set up at Jules Morin Park and will also operate Friday through Sunday, according to an OPH notice to families. Two people associated with De La Salle, including one staff member, have tested positive for COVID-19 according to provincial data.
In a statement to this newspaper, Ontario Health explained that three mobile testing teams have been deployed to Ottawa “to targeted areas with known prevalence,” including some schools where students have tested positive for COVID-19.
“Ottawa Public Health is supporting these teams by working with the schools and families to determine who might need a test at the schools. It’s important that the public do not seek out these pop-ups as they have a limited capacity and are focused on targeting the school population.”
The location of these mobile teams “could change in the coming days and weeks depending on need; they may continue to target schools or other specific centres with known prevalence – or they may set up near an assessment centre that’s experiencing very high volumes in order to better support a broader population.”
Ontario Health will be working with local partners to “identify new places that might benefit from these teams,” the statement noted.
The third team appears to have set up Friday at the Heron Road care clinic to add additional testing capacity at this location.

— Hôpital Montfort (@hopitalmontfort) September 18, 2020
Etches conceded that the “evolving guidance” on who should be tested has been a challenge for people, and she sought to clarify the issue.
“The simplest way I can put this is: Ottawa Public Health is currently recommending testing for those showing new symptoms of COVID-19 or if you have been instructed by OPH to seek testing,” she said.
Etches also offered a more detailed, situational breakdown, saying:
If someone in your household becomes ill with symptoms, everyone in the household should self-isolate, but only the person with symptoms should be tested. Others in the household do not need to be tested unless they have COVID symptoms or have been instructed to go for testing by OPH, but they do need to stay home until the original test comes back negative.
If you or your child develops symptoms, including something like a runny nose, and you choose to not be tested for COVID-19, you both will have to stay home from work or school for 14 days. You should not return to work or school until you are symptom-free for at least 24 hours.
If you are contacted by OPH because your child is considered a close contact of someone else who has tested positive, your child will have to self-isolate for 14 days from the time they were in contact with the person who has COVID-19. Your child should get tested after five days, or as soon as symptoms appear. If your child does not have symptoms, other members of the household do not need to self-isolate unless they have symptoms. If there are siblings without symptoms, they can go back to school.
If you receive an emailed letter from your child’s school because someone who works or attends the school has tested positive, no further action is required if you do not hear from OPH directly by email or phone. Your child can continue to attend school and does not need to be tested unless they are instructed to do so by OPH. In the event of a school outbreak, the same follow-up recommendations would occur. OPH will tell you when to self-isolate and seek testing
A medical officer of health in eastern Ontario says slow lab turnaround times for COVID-19 tests is hampering local public health efforts to do effective contact tracing and control outbreaks.
Dr. Robert Cushman, acting medical officer of health with Renfrew County and District Health Unit, says universal testing for COVID-19 has led to major problems such as expired samples and test results that take upwards of seven days to get back, and instead advocated for “strategic testing.”
He says the slow turnaround times in the Ottawa laboratories where the health unit sends their samples for processing have hindered investigations into COVID-19 cases at a local school and a popular gym.
“It’s bad science to do universal testing, but it’s good politics,” he says.
Dr. David Williams, Ontario’s chief medical officer of health, also criticized the slow turnaround times in Ottawa.
“I have heard about long delays in getting results back and that’s not acceptable,” Williams said.
He said the city labs, which are overseen by the Ottawa Hospital, are dealing with “logistical issues they’re trying to work through.”
The hospital did not immediately provide comment.
Meanwhile, the west end care clinic on Moodie Drive closed its line at around 9 a.m., shortly after opening, because the site had reached maximum capacity for the day.
Provincial
On the subject of surging COVID-19 testing demand, Premier Doug Ford said Friday he’s hopeful that by this time next week, “we’ll have numerous pharmacies out there, helping out the system.”
But, despite a request earlier in the day by Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson to change the messaging to dissuade asymptomatic people from adding to long testing lineups, Ford talked about “the asymptomatic folks, that may be anxious, they want to get tested – god bless them, get tested.
“We’re going to be prepared … I can tell you, I’m pushing the system like no one’s ever pushed it in Ontario before.”
“We can’t work at government speed, we have to work at COVID speed.”
Ford also noted that the new private gathering limits applied in Ottawa, Toronto and Peel (up to 10 people at indoor gatherings, 25 outside) will be rolling out in other areas of the province, on the request of local mayors and medical officers of health.
For the first time since mid-June, Ontario’s daily COVID-19 new case count exceeded 400 on Friday, with 401 more people testing positive across the province.
That includes 130 people in Toronto and 82 in Peel.
There are now 2,652 active cases of COVID-19 across the province, including 58 people in hospital, 20 in ICU and 10 on ventilators.
No new COVID-19 deaths were reported in Ontario in the last day.
Ford also spoke at length Friday about his intention to ensure personal support workers are paid more, a critical element of ensuring staff retention in long-term care homes to try to prevent the second wave of COVID-19 from claiming the lives it did during the first wave.
“PSWs in the province of Ontario are underpaid, overworked, and until we bring up the pay – which we’re doing, because I’m all over Health right now to get this through Treasury as soon as possible – we (can’t) attract more people,” said Ford.
He also contrasted PSWs with “all the people that may be complaining about their job.”
“Really? In safe environments? Start looking at some of the other heroes that have been working their backs off to save our most vulnerable.”
Aside from Ottawa, the Eastern Ontario Health Unit was the only one in the eastern Ontario region to report a growth in cases in the last day, with three new cases reported.
According to the provincial webpage tracking COVID-19 in schools, there are now 18 Ottawa schools with at least one confirmed case: 10 schools in the French Catholic board, four in the French public board and four in the English Catholic board.
Only one school in Ontario has been closed due to COVID-19 cases, and that’s Fellowes High School in Pembroke. According to the Renfrew County and District health unit, the outbreak currently involves four staff and one student case.
On Thursday, the health unit tested 83 staff and 15 students at the school, and is running a second pop-up testing clinic Friday for the rest of the staff and students at the school.
National
Canada’s premiers are calling on the federal government to immediately increase its contribution to the Canada Health Transfer by $28 billion to bring its contribution to provincial and territorial health care spending to 35 per cent, and maintain this percentage in the years to come.
“We’ve seen health care costs escalate overwhelmingly over this pandemic,” said Ontario Premier Doug Ford, at a press conference with fellow conservative premiers.
From backlogs on surgeries to the need to expand hospital and long-term care, “We can’t sustain it. We have a system that is broken when it comes to health care,” said Ford.
“This is not a knock against one particular political stripe or party or government – this, folks, has been going on for decades.”
Ford said he’s looking forward to next week’s throne speech by the federal government.
“I can’t be any more clear – we need your support, we’re in desperate need of your support.”
Dr. Howard Njoo, deputy chief public health officer, said Friday it was too soon to declare the country was experiencing a “second wave” of COVID-19 infections, but “the trend is definitely going the wrong way.”
“I respect (Ottawa’s) Dr. Etches statement, she has the facts and information,” Njoo said.
However, he noted the rates varied widely across the county, with “concerning” increases in cases in the country’s four largest provinces.
The made-in-Ontario COVID Alert notification app became fully operational in Saskatchewan and New Brunswick on Friday.
App users in both provinces who test positive for COVID-19 receive a one-time key they can use to notify other app users they may have been in close contact with a potential COVID-19 patients.
Four provinces have so far adopted the app. Ontario was the first to adopt it, followed by Newfoundland and Labrador.
Premier François Legault repeated the unanimous concern in the province’s National Assembly over protection of app users’ personal data. He left the door open to possibly adopting the app in the future.
The app’s creators say it does not collect identifiable information from its users.
Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet has tested positive for COVID-19, the party says.
Blanchet was already in self-isolation after a staff member was diagnosed as having the illness. In a statement, Blanchet says he feels healthy.
As expected, Public Safety Minister Bill Blair announced Friday that the Canada-U.S. border will remain closed to non-essential travel until Oct. 21.
The mutual ban has been in place since March 21. It does not restrict most trade, commerce and essential employees.
As of Friday morning, Health Canada was reporting a total of 140,887 cases of COVID-19 since the pandemic began. There are 8,558 cases nationwide.
There have been 9,200 deaths.
Quebec
The Outaouais will be one of eight Quebec regions getting extra attention during a second weekend crackdown across the province to ensure bars and restaurants — and their customers — are respecting public health rules. The eight regions, including Montreal, are under a yellow alert in the province’s new colour-coded pandemic warning system.
More than 1,000 bars and restaurants are to be visited. Scofflaws could face fines of between $400 and $6,000.
Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault said the effort will not target gatherings and parties in private homes, noting that police require a warrant to enter.
Quebec reported 297 new cases of COVID-19 and one additional death on Friday. The Outaouais accounted for nine of those new cases, while the region’s COVID-19 death toll remains at 34.
Across the province, 136 people are hospitalized with the disease including 30 in ICU.
On Wednesday, 29,726 Quebecers were tested for COVID-19, a new record. That’s the last day for which screening data is available.

DENVER — The University of Colorado has forced some students to move out of their dorms to create more isolation housing for students with coronavirus infections as case numbers continue to increase at the Boulder campus.
The Denver Post reported that the university said in an email to affected students that those living in the Darley North tower at the Williams Village complex must move to other residence halls within the complex by 5 p.m. Sunday.
The announcement came as the university reported 130 newly confirmed coronavirus cases, bringing the total to 671 cases since classes began about a month ago.
Officials say two-thirds of on-campus isolation space at the university is already full, with 151 beds in use out of 267 available as of Thursday.
Guatemalan president tests positive for virus
GUATEMALA CITY — Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei said Friday he has tested positive for the new coronavirus, but he told a local radio station he feels well.
However, in a televised address to the nation, Giammattei looked a bit out of breath.
“My symptoms are very mild. Up to now, I have body aches, it hurt more yesterday than today, like a bad cold,” the president said. “I don’t have a fever, I have a bit of a cough.”
“I am busy working from home,” he said.
Giammattei, 64, has multiple sclerosis and uses canes to walk.
The government press office said in a statement that Giammattei “will be isolating himself from all public activity, and so all communication will be conducted remotely.”
The announcement came on the same day that the country reopened its borders and international flights after a six-month closure due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Hawaii will repoen to tourists Oct. 15 – with some conditions
Travelers can finally return to Hawaii starting next month.
Beginning Oct. 15, visitors can travel to the islands if they take a coronavirus test and test negative within 72 hours of their arrival in the state, or go into a 14-day quarantine once they arrive.
Gov. David Ige, a Democrat, announced plans for the pre-travel testing program at a news conference this week.
Ige said pharmacy chain CVS and health-care provider Kaiser Permanente will offer tests as part of an agreement with the state. In a news release, the state said only FDA-approved coronavirus tests known as nucleic acid amplification tests are approved as part of Hawaii’s travel program.
Audrey McAvoy/Associated Press
Travelers also must have their temperature checked upon arrival and complete a travel and health form.
If their test results aren’t available upon arrival, visitors must remain in quarantine until they get the result, Lt. Gov. Josh Green said during the news conference. Green joined virtually because he recently tested positive for the disease and said he is isolating at home.
Green said the new travel program will be an economic boost for the state “when so many people are suffering.”
The state has been effectively closed to visitors amid the pandemic, which has had a devastating economic impact.
“I worry about the long-term impacts of economic distress and that impact it’s had on our people when they can’t afford their homes as easily or their groceries or their health care,” Green said. “So this is an important announcement the governor has made today.”
Hawaii last month delayed the reopening of the state to mainland travelers. The August postponement was the second time Hawaii delayed its reopening to out-of-state travelers in 2020.
Armed residents confront COVID-19 testing team in Minnesota
MINNEAPOLIS — A team of health workers conducting random COVID-19 testing was recently confronted by armed residents in a Minnesota neighborhood, though state officials have not said when or where the incident occurred.
Health officials have been doing random testing of households in 180 Minnesota communities since Monday to help understand how COVID-19 is spread. The state hasn’t said where the studies are being conducted.
Minnesota Department of Health spokeswoman Julie Bartkey told the St. Paul Pioneer Press that the team did the right thing by leaving the situation and notifying a site coordinator.
“The vast majority of neighborhoods have been friendly, but we will continue to monitor for concerns as we move through different areas of the state,” Bartkey said. “It could have been a simple misunderstanding, we simply don’t know.”
The workers from the state Department of Health and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are wearing credentials as they knock on doors. Households are chosen at random, and state officials have encouraged participation if asked. The study includes an interview and testing for active COVID-19 infections as well as antibody testing that would indicate a previous exposure.
The incident came to light after at least two Twin Cities-area police departments posted an email from the Minnesota Department of Public Safety on their social media accounts. The message said: “a team of MDH and CDC examiners was recently confronted by a group of armed citizens while out in a neighborhood.”
Minnesota reported an additional 1,099 cases of the coronavirus on Friday, and eight new deaths, bringing the state’s totals to 87,807 confirmed cases and 1,950 deaths since the pandemic began.
Push is underway to test COVID-19 vaccines in diverse groups
TAKOMA PARK, Md. — In front of baskets of tomatoes and peppers, near a sizzling burrito grill, the “promotoras” stop masked shoppers at a busy Latino farmers market: Want to test a COVID-19 vaccine?
Aided by Spanish-speaking “health promoters” and Black pastors, a stepped-up effort is underway around the U.S. to recruit minorities to ensure potential vaccines against the scourge are tested in the populations most ravaged by the virus.
Many thousands of volunteers from minority groups are needed for huge clinical trials underway or about to begin. Scientists say a diverse group of test subjects is vital to determining whether a vaccine is safe and effective for everyone and instilling broad public confidence in the shots once they become available.
The expanded outreach by vaccine researchers and health officials is getting a late start in communities that, because of a history of scientific exploitation and racism, may be the most reluctant to roll up their sleeves.
Federica Narancio/Associated Press
Just getting the word out takes time.
“I didn’t know anything about the vaccine until now,” said Ingrid Guerra, who signed up last week at the farmers market in Takoma Park, Maryland, outside the nation’s capital.
The health promoters from CASA, a Hispanic advocacy group, explained how the research process works and how a vaccine could help end the coronavirus pandemic.
“I’m not afraid,” Guerra decided. “I want to participate for me, my family, my people.”
University of Maryland researchers agreed to set up a temporary lab at CASA’s local community center so that people struggling financially wouldn’t have to travel to participate.
The hardest part, many experts say, is gaining trust.
“A white guy from NIH is probably not going to be as effective by far in convincing somebody from a minority community that this is the kind of science they might want to trust, as would a doctor from their own community,” said Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health.
Recruiting African Americans in particular will be “a heavy, heavy lift,” Collins said, because of the legacy of mistrust after the infamous Tuskegee experiment, when Black men in Alabama were left untreated for syphilis as part of a study that ran from the 1930s into the ‘70s.

A Mass. teenager tested positive for the coronavirus. His parents sent him to school anyway.
Six students tested positive for the novel coronavirus days before Attleboro High School in Massachusetts reopened its doors for the first day of school this week. Only five of them stayed home, the city’s mayor told WJAR.
The parents of the sixth student who tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 sent him to class anyway, the mayor said. Now, 28 students who were in close contact with the teenager have to quarantine for two weeks.
“It was a reckless action to send a child — a teenager — to school who was COVID-positive,” Attleboro Mayor Paul Heroux (D) told WHDH. “It was really poor judgment. If you know that your child has coronavirus, is covid-positive, you should not send your child to school under any circumstances.”
As the new academic year begins, schools nationwide have had to cope with students coming to school despite knowing that they have the highly infectious virus. In Oklahoma City, a student also attended the first day in class despite testing positive for the coronavirus. The parents of the student said they thought the quarantine was only for five days because the child was asymptomatic. As a result, 17 students had to quarantine. A student in Greenfield, Ind., meanwhile, tested positive on the first day of school after the parents sent the child while awaiting test results.
The student in Attleboro, located almost 40 miles southwest of Boston, tested positive for the coronavirus on Sept. 11, Heroux told CNN. But the school was unaware of his results when he arrived for the first day on Sept. 14.
The high school became aware of the student’s positive test because of rumors “circulating around town,” Runey told NBC. The suspicions were reported to the city’s bureau of health, which “did some checking and found out that it was true, that he had tested positive,” Runey said.
In a letter to families in the school district, which was reviewed by WHDH, Superintendent David Sawyer said that the school’s nurses used contact tracing to identify and notify those who were in close contact with the student.
“This is bad. Parents are really angry,” Heroux told WJAR.
Florida, Texas and Nevada take steps toward 2nd reopening
Several states that moved quickly to lift lockdown restrictions this summer — only to slam the brakes as coronavirus infections began surging — are once again moving ahead with reopening.
In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott (R) announced Thursday that restaurants, retail stores and gyms in most parts of the state could resume operating at 75 percent occupancy, the limit that was in place in June before Abbott reversed course and imposed new restrictions. Bars, however, will remain closed. The state is also resuming elective surgeries in most hospital districts, with exceptions for parts of the Rio Grande Valley that are still seeing high numbers of hospitalizations.
In Nevada, a state coronavirus task force authorized reopening bars in Clark County, where Las Vegas is located, for the first time since July. Shutdowns were also lifted for Elko County, which had been the only other county where bars remained closed because of a failure to meet key testing metrics.

Florida also plowed ahead with reopening this week, allowing bars statewide to welcome back patrons at 50 percent capacity. Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) initially closed bars when outbreaks began appearing in March, but allowed them to reopen in early June, a move that was followed by a steep uptick in cases. Later that month, state liquor regulators intervened and shut down bars for a second time.
According to Politico Florida, contact tracing teams determined that many of the summer outbreaks were spawned by a handful of bars that flouted social distancing and capacity regulations. Halsey Beshears, the secretary of the state’s Department of Business and Professional Regulation, said in a statement last week that he believed bars and breweries would do better the second time around.
“It’s vital that we start moving forward with this sector of our hospitality industry who have endured one of the toughest paths for sustaining a business during this pandemic,” he said.
DeSantis also said last week that he expects to soon lift a restriction limiting indoor dining to 50 percent capacity, according to Politico.
Global virus cases top 30 million, 6.7 million in U.S. alone
LONDON – Confirmed cases of the coronavirus have topped 30 million worldwide, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally.
The worldwide count of known COVID-19 infections climbed past 30 million on Thursday, with more than half of them from just three countries: the U.S., India and Brazil, according to the tally kept by Johns Hopkins researchers.
The number increased by 10 million in just over a month; global cases passed 20 million on August 12.
The United States leads the by-country count with at least 6,675,560 reported cases, followed by India with at least 5,214,677 and Brazil at 4,455, 386, the numbers showed.
Individual numbers could vary as the university’s tally sometimes lags behind country reports.
The U.S. also leads in the number of deaths at 197,643, followed by Brazil at 134,935 and India with a death toll of 84,372, the tally showed.
Britain considers new curbs on pubs and restaurants
LONDON — British Health Secretary Matt Hancock has hinted that fresh restrictions on social gatherings in England could be announced soon as part of efforts to suppress a sharp spike in confirmed coronavirus cases.
Following reports that the government was considering fresh curbs on the hospitality sector, such as pubs and restaurants, Hancock said this is a “big moment for the country.”
He said that another national lockdown is the “last line of defense” and that most transmissions of the virus are taking place in social settings.
Hancock says the government’s strategy over the coming weeks is to contain the virus as much as possible “whilst protecting education and the economy.”
The government has come under sustained criticism in the past week following serious issues with its virus testing program.
There’s widespread speculation that parts of northwest England will see further restrictions announced Friday.
India’s infections not slowing
NEW DELHI — India’s coronavirus cases have jumped by another 96,424 infections in the past 24 hours, showing little signs of slowing down.
The Health Ministry on Friday raised the nation’s confirmed total since the pandemic began to more than 5.21 million. It said 1,174 more people died in the past 24 hours, for a total of 84,372.
India is expected within weeks to surpass the reported infections seen in the United States, where more than 6.67 million people have been reported infected, the most in the world.
India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday made a fresh appeal to people to use face masks and maintain social distance as his government chalked out plans to handle big congregations expected during a major Hindu festival season beginning next month.
UN official warns 270 million are in danger of starvation
UNITED NATIONS — U.N. World Food Program chief David Beasley is warning that 270 million people are “marching toward the brink of starvation” because of the toxic combination of conflict, climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic.
Beasley on Thursday urged donor nations and billionaires to contribute $4.9 billion to feed the 30 million he said will die without U.N. assistance.
He reminded the U.N. Security Council of his warning five months ago that “the world stood on the brink of a hunger pandemic,” and welcomed the response, which averted famine and led countries to fight back against the coronavirus.
Beasley said the U.N. food agency is keeping people alive “and avoiding a humanitarian catastrophe” but he said “the fight is far, far, far from over.”
New Zealand reports no new cases for the first time in 5 weeks
WELLINGTON, New Zealand — New Zealand has reported no new confirmed cases of the coronavirus for the first time in more than five weeks as hopes rise that an outbreak discovered in Auckland last month has been stamped out.
Friday’s report also marked the fourth consecutive day without any cases of community transmission. All recent cases have been found among quarantined travelers returning from abroad.
Authorities have still not pinpointed the origin of the August outbreak, which they believe was imported. Auckland was temporarily placed into lockdown as the country continued its strategy of trying to completely eliminate community spread of the virus.
New Zealand has reported a total of just over 1,800 cases and 25 deaths.
China reports small number of imported cases
BEIJING — China says imported coronavirus cases climbed to 32 over the previous 24 hours.
Thirteen of the cases reported Friday were in the northern province of Shaanxi, whose capital Xi’an is a major industrial center. The eastern financial and business hub of Shanghai reported 12.
China has gone more than a month without reporting any cases of locally transmitted coronavirus cases within its borders.
But it remains highly vigilant for cases brought in from outside the country. It has suspended issuing new visas and anyone arriving from abroad is required to undergo a two-week quarantine.
Calif. law mandates workers be told if exposed to virus
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — California companies must pay workers compensation benefits to any employees that become infected with the coronavirus and they must warn employees of any potential exposure to the virus under two laws that Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Thursday.
Business groups have criticized the measures as “unworkable.”
The law on informing employees requires that businesses tell workers whenever they they have been exposed to someone who has either tested positive, been ordered to isolate or died because of the virus. Companies must do so within one business day of learning of the exposures or they can face fines issued by the Division of Occupational Safety and Health."

Prioritizing the well-being of its stakeholders amid the COVID-19 pandemic, The Barstow School in suburban Kansas City has deployed Black & Veatch’s Rapid Modular Health System (RaMHS) structures to assist with coronavirus screenings of students, faculty and staff.
The RaMHS module represents a swift response to COVID-19 conditions and complements the school’s “Back to Barstow 2020 Return-to-Campus Plan” developed in consultation with the school’s administrative leadership and medical advisory committee. It also illustrates the school’s flexibility and readiness in adapting procedures – including the use of germ-killing ultraviolet wands and lamps – in response to public health recommendations. The RaMHS unit will provide a second location for students to receive daily temperature screenings, making campus arrival and check-in more efficient.
“The Barstow School is pleased to partner with Black & Veatch to offer the innovative RaMHS unit to our school community,” said Shane Foster, president of The Barstow School, which emphasizes science, technology, engineering, math (STEM) and the arts (STEAM). “As we are firmly committed to ensuring the health and safety of our students and to showing them how innovation results in real-world solutions, this partnership provides an effective way to achieve both goals.”
Developed by Black & Veatch – a 105-year-old global infrastructure leader with vast experience in pathogen-tracking methods and the construction of biological safety-related facilities – the RaMHS units are scalable, intermodal containers transformed into comfortable sites for COVID-19 screening and other diagnostic purposes, as well as vaccination distribution and personal protective equipment (PPE) disinfection and dispensing. These windowed modules come in various sizes and configurations, electrical hook-up ready, weather-resistant, climate controlled, and lockable, providing security for personnel and equipment in any environment. The units can be outfitted with the latest in COVID response technology from a variety of partners.
The uniquely adaptable RaMHS module, which provides an alternate testing and screening site outside of traditional emergency room or doctor office settings, gives schools, health-care sites, office parks, government locations, commercial and industrial businesses, and retail locations the peace of mind of having a reliable, affordable coronavirus testing place within days. RaMHS modules already have been put to use by a Kansas City-area health system and by the University of Kansas.
“We applaud The Barstow School’s proactiveness in safeguarding the health and safety for its students and employees,” said Dave Johnson, the RaMHS solutions team leader at Black & Veatch, which also is exploring options to collaborate with Barstow in transforming a former supermarket into an off-campus site. “Through that conversion effort and RaMHS, we look forward to building a continuing partnership with Barstow that shares our passion for STEM and safety.”
The climate-controlled RaMHS modules can be quickly daisy-chained to meet community and regional demands. In conjunction with other personal protective gear, this design can reduce exposure risks. RaMHS also is a hub where personal protection equipment can be disinfected and data can be harvested and analyzed to record and measure where patients have been.
The RaMHS program follows the recent announcement of Black & Veatch’s Growth Accelerator incubator to find and collaborate with startups and other innovators to expedite solutions that soften COVID-19’s impact. As a virtual, remote effort, the 2020 Black & Veatch IgniteX COVID-19 Response Accelerator has engaged companies and entrepreneurs who have real-time ideas about how to mitigate the coronavirus outbreak and need help commercializing, rapidly deploying and scaling those concepts.

Similar thoughts are also on the minds of those in neighboring states.
It has started out shakily, however, including pre-arrival outbreaks producing 254 cases associated with 51 schools. One late-August outbreak following an off-campus party near St. Olaf College in Northfield resulted in 17 suspensions and 50 quarantines during the week before students moved on campus. These drew the concern of state health officials, who had rolled out a ""Lay Low Before You Go"" message at the start of the month, telling students to avoid parties in the last weeks of summer.
""Preliminary data unfortunately demonstrates quite clearly the risk of students and staff bringing COVID-19 with them when they return to campus,"" said Minnesota director of infectious disease Kris Ehresmann during an Aug. 28 press call.
""Just because a college has an outbreak doesn't mean the institution did something wrong,"" Ehresmann added. ""Most of the cases associated with a college or university setting during the week of Aug. 17 likely occurred off-campus. ""
""We are concerned about the college towns,"" Gov. Tim Walz said during a press conference on Thursday, Sept. 3. ""We've seen that whether it's Mankato, Winona and of course here in Minneapolis and St. Paul and others. ""What I have believed from the beginning is the partners in this are the establishments themselves.""
Macalester College in St. Paul took an early, aggressive approach to COVID-19, including an extensive mitigation plan that included a campus-wide ""quiet period"" from move-in until Sept. 16 in which ""every member of the community will minimize their in-person interactions both on and off campus."" The COVID-19 plan for students at the University of St. Thomas advises students to ""stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings, including parties or other social events off campus that violate social distancing guidelines.""
Thursday night, however, an image circulated on social media of a line outside of Plums, a popular bar serving St. Paul college students from Macalester College, University of St. Thomas, and elsewhere.
Minnesota has almost 200 colleges and universities, all of which are required to have developed a preparedness plan.
Minnesota's private colleges have posted their preparedness plans, and these fall under the 16 pages of guidance for colleges and universities set out by the Minnesota Department of Health.
The largest of these institutions, the University of Minnesota system, has since rolled back its starting dates to Sept. 9 for its Duluth campus, Sept. 15 for the Twin Cities campuses, and Sept. 18 for its Rochester campus, citing the need for ""a brief pause to learn from the challenges our peers around the country are experiencing,"" according to a statement released by University of Minnesota president Joan Gabel.
On Wednesday, Sept. 2, the university unveiled its Maroon and Gold Sunrise Plan, which sets out four stages of COVID-19 restrictions. Progressively tiered from most-restrictive to least-restrictive, the dialback indicators offer the school flexibility to open up student life or alternately close it down in stages should an outbreak worsen.
Step One, the stage that will greet U of M students when they arrive in the coming days and weeks, requires that ""students will live and learn almost exclusively within residence halls."" It states that ""students should not visit other residence halls, nor businesses or residences off campus,"" effectively quarantining students to their dorms and meal halls.
Meals halls are just one of the dozens of practical problems laid out in the MDH guidance. It limits class sizes, requires seating monitors, masking indoors, 6-foot distances for teachers and students -- although less for lab partners -- assigned seating in labs, quarantine space and that ""social gatherings not associated with a class or structured event or meeting must not exceed 10 indoors, or 25 outdoors,"" -- a de facto ban on campus parties.
Minnesota health officials do not recommend start-up testing for arriving college students, unless they have symptoms or are exposed to COVID-19.
""We want to be sure testing is done for those who need it,"" said state epidemiologist Dr. Ruth Lynfield at a recent press call. ""We are not going to be able to test our way out of this.""
""Having a negative test doesn't mean you have a green light to go socialize and not keep the distance.""
""There has been a lot of great work and planning done at the universities and colleges,"" said Lynfield, ""including consultation with the health department. We don't want to lose the opportunity for people to have good educational experiences (as a result of) some people partying. What the college will be able to offer depends on how people do. We'll have to see how that plays out.""
UND already challenged
The University of North Dakota in Grand Forks has been dealing with hundreds of coronavirus cases since classes started Aug. 24.
As of 9 a.m. Thursday, the university’s COVID-19 dashboard, which updates in real time, showed 194 self-reported, active cases of coronavirus. Of that number 182 were students, 10 were staff and two were faculty. But those numbers are down slightly compared in comparison to last week when total active cases crossed 300. In total, the university listed 645 individuals in quarantine or isolation as of Thursday morning.
The university’s positivity rate has been around 10% for the last week.
UND makes up a large chunk of Grand Forks County cases. As of Thursday, there were 491 active cases in the county, of those cases 303 were between the ages of 20 to 29.
UND has contracted with local hotels to purchase rooms for students who have tested positive for the virus or who may be a close contact of a positive case but may not have a place to isolate or quarantine alone.
UND has around 322 hotels set aside for COVID isolations and quarantines, according to Jed Shivers, UND’s vice president of finance. The university may have the ability to get more rooms if needed. As of Thursday a little less than half of the hotel rooms were in use.
Face coverings and maintaining a 6-foot distance are required when on campus. Face masks are not required off campus.
About 30-40% of the student population has been tested for the virus thus far, though UND President Andrew Armacost has said that number is flexible because it’s not clear how many students have been tested more than once. That percentage is the highest among North Dakota University System institutions, however.
University officials, including Armacost, say they believe that the university’s testing structure helps them quickly identify positive cases and get them into isolation and close contacts into quarantine.
“When you bring 10,000 people to town and test as aggressively as we have been, I don't think it's any surprise that we will find positive cases,” he said. “When you increase the population by 10,000 in the county that group can certainly impact the overall county numbers as well, which is what we're seeing.”
As of Tuesday, Armacost said the university does not have plans to move to online only classes yet. But the university did ask students to stay in Grand Forks over the Labor Day weekend to avoid potential spread in other towns, per the advice of Dr. Deborah Birx, the coronavirus response coordinator for the White House.
A week ago, North Dakota State in Fargo independently reported 39 students and two employees who have tested positive for the virus in the last two weeks. In mid-August, drive-up testing at the Fargodome was aimed at NDSU students, faculty and K-12 teachers.
S.D. campuses affected
In South Dakota, the state’s public university system geared up for the arrival of students by installing Abbott ID Now rapid-test devices in student health centers and implementing masking requirements and other social distancing strategies.
Students moved into dorms and started classes in mid-August and on-campus COVID-19 cases quickly surged from dozens to hundreds, mostly at the state’s two biggest universities, South Dakota State University in Brookings and University of South Dakota in Vermillion.
As of Sept. 3, South Dakota’s public universities were reporting 422 active cases of COVID-19 among students and employees, with 1,260 in isolation in quarantine.
SDSU and USD were home to the largest clusters of COVID-19 among students and staff. USD alone has about half of all active cases and individuals in quarantine, with 234 active cases with 666 in quarantine. SDSU, with 11,500 students, had 87 active cases with 310 in quarantine.
“We feel our … universities are taking it very seriously and being proactive in trying to address (COVID-19) on their campuses,” said Kim Malsam-Rysdon, secretary of the state Department of Health, on Thursday.
There was some initial confusion over who would report COVID-19 cases to the public. While the state Department of Health provides a weekly report of total cases from the state’s public university, it has refused to say how many cases are at each university, citing privacy concerns, and said it would only be more specific if an outbreak occurs.
Instead, the state Board of Regents, which governs the universities, created a real-time data dashboard for each university, which breaks down the number of cases by students and employees, and indicates how many people are in quarantine or isolation, and whether they’re at home or on-campus.
The rise in on-campus cases mirrored a statewide COVID-19 case surge, as daily active cases in the state tripled from about 1,000 in mid-August to 3,000 in early September. But both surges are causing concern in cities that are home to the state’s public universities, now grappling with an influx of thousands of highly social students.
The city council of Brookings, home to SDSU, faced a raucous crowd this week as it weighed whether to extend business restrictions and implement a mask mandate due to the pandemic.
But Barry Dunn, the university's president, spoke in support of keeping and expanding pandemic-related restrictions on local businesses, drawing both applause and boos from the crowd.
“I remain very concerned the virus is increasing exponentially, as we’ve heard,” he said in a video captured by The Collegian, the university’s student newspaper."
209,https://www.10news.com/news/coronavirus/san-diego-state-university-reports-120-more-covid-19-cases-since-fall-start,-0.54,San Diego State University reports 120 more COVID-19 cases since fall start,"SAN DIEGO (KGTV) — San Diego State says 120 more confirmed and probably coronavirus cases have been reported in the school's off- and on-campus student population.
The new cases bring SDSU's total student COVID-19 count to 184 cases since the fall semester began last week.
The school says county health officials it investigating ""multiple clusters"" of coronavirus cases among students in the university community, including a previously announced outbreak on Wednesday.
Officials say among the cases, 14 groups have been identified within different locations. Some of these groups may eventually be linked to outbreaks.
SDSU says none of the cases under investigation are related to on-campus educational activities, including classes or labs. No known cases have been reported in school faculty, staff, visitors, or vendors.
The school advised that all undergraduates students who have attended gatherings or think they may have been exposed should get tested and isolate themselves. The county estimated that each SDSU student case averages 4.5 contacts each.
“SDSU undergrads need to stay home within their living units this weekend and help us stop the spread within your campus community,” said Wilma Wooten, County public health officer. “If you have been to parties and social events, you need to get tested, now. And isolate until you get results.”
Students can call 2-1-1 or their medical providers and stay home if they become ill. They may also contact Student Health Services at 619-594-4325 (Monday through Friday) or the Nurse Call Line at 858-225-3105 (after hours and during weekends and holidays). Testing is available by appointment only and can be scheduled online here.
This week, SDSU moved all courses online for at least 4 weeks in response to the growing number of students testing positive. The campus had been hosting about 200 classes in-person, many of which were lab classes that were determined to only be possible in person.
Thursday, SDSU also paused all athletic events for two weeks.
When the school becomes aware that a student resident has tested positive or is exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms, an Assessment and Response Team is used to isolate the sick student and, if needed, close contacts are notified, according to Luke Wood, Vice President for Student Affairs and Campus Diversity.
Several campus apartments have been designated for isolating students when needed. For those isolated, a hygiene kit and food and meal delivery are provided by SDSU to those isolated students, Wood added.
To address the spread of the virus among students, the school banned fraternity events and instituted several policies, which include hiring security to patrol the campus after hours, document violations, and report to staff who handle disciplinary action. Greeters, or wellness ambassadors, are also on campus to remind students of COVID-19 policies.
Violation of the policies can result in suspension or in extreme cases, expulsion.
As of Friday, SDSU has issued 457 COVID-19 policy violations. Of those, 285 have already been settled and eight organizations have been issued notices of investigation. Two notices to organizations are also in progress, Wood said.
The university is encouraging students to avoid gatherings over the Labor Day weekend and says more patrols have been established in the campus area ahead of the weekend."

The Renfrew County and District Health Unit said it was notified that the student had tested positive late Thursday night.
So far, four staff members and the student have tested positive at the Ottawa Valley school, which has 650 students and about 55 employees.
The health unit shut down Fellowes on Wednesday after three staff members tested positive, making it the first Ontario school to close due to a COVID-19 outbreak.
A pop-up testing centre in Pembroke is testing staff and students at 7 International Dr. So far, almost all staff at the school have been tested, the health unit said, as well as most students thought to be at the highest risk.
The health unit is asking people to continue practising physical distancing, keep up hand hygiene and maintain small social bubbles. Anyone who feels unwell should stay home.
To book a COVID-19 test in the region, the health unit says locals can visit the Renfrew County Virtual Triage Assessment Centre website or call 1-844-727-6404."

Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said it is the “early, initial hypothesis” that the commuting van started the outbreak.
“One of the linkages we have identified that may have generated the outbreak is a group of individuals commuting together from Sanford to the naval shipyard,” Shah said at a Thursday afternoon news briefing. “Seven of the nine individuals who were part of that commuting van have tested positive.”
Gary Hildreth, spokesman for the shipyard, said in a statement that “those in the vanpool did not wear cloth face masks while commuting to and from work.”
The Maine CDC reported that 16 of the 18 people in the shipyard outbreak were employees, while the other two were close household contacts of employees. Of those who have fallen ill in connection with the shipyard outbreak, 13 are from Maine, four from New Hampshire and one from Massachusetts. It was not clear Thursday how many of the commuter van occupants were from Sanford, Maine CDC spokesman Robert Long said.
“All personnel were placed in a quarantine status at their residence for 14 days,” Hildreth said.
The shipyard issued slightly different case totals than the Maine CDC, with Hildreth saying there are 15 positive COVID-19 cases that can be attributed to a privately operated vanpool from Sanford. Of those, he said seven were in the vanpool and eight “are the result of close contact with members of the vanpool or work in the same vicinity as the positive vanpool members.”
It wasn’t clear Thursday what caused the discrepancy in the case totals.
“Since March, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard has emphasized the importance of remaining vigilant at work, at home and in the community in order to minimize the risk of spread of coronavirus,” Hildreth said in the statement. The shipyard started up numerous measures that included providing cloth face masks to employees, cleaning and disinfecting upgrades, social distancing and working remotely when possible.
The Maine CDC reported a total of 25 new cases statewide, including eight in York County.
Other outbreaks reported Thursday include three cases at Baker Company in Sanford and four cases at Buffalo Wild Wings in Auburn.
No additional deaths were recorded, and among the remaining new cases, four were in Cumberland County, the state’s most populous county.

On Wednesday, the agency reported an outbreak of four cases at Elks Lodge 1470 in Sanford, where there have been outbreaks at four other social clubs.
Case totals related to those four clubs have been rising as the Maine CDC investigates, and the most recent figures show 12 cases at American Legion Post 19, eight cases at the Amvets post, 10 cases at the Lafayette Social Club and 10 cases at Sanford Veterans of Foreign Wars.
Long said investigators have learned that some of the individuals infected by the disease went to more than one of the clubs.
The American Legion outbreak was originally associated with a funeral reception.
The social clubs are part of a growing list of outbreaks in York County, including more than 70 cases at the York County Jail, 10 at Calvary Baptist Church in Sanford, and smaller outbreaks at the Sanford Fire Department and other locations. The jail outbreak began with a jail employee who attended a wedding and reception in the Millinocket area on Aug. 7 that has been connected to 177 cases statewide and seven deaths.
The pastor at Calvary Baptist Church, Todd Bell, officiated at the wedding, although there is not yet a firm epidemiological link between the outbreak at Calvary Baptist and the wedding.
Also on Thursday, Gov. Janet Mills announced at the news briefing that she would sign a “curtailment order” for the state budget that avoids major cuts in services by replacing $97 million in state spending with one-time federal funding from the CARES Act coronavirus relief fund. Combined with increased federal reimbursements, hiring freezes and other measures, the moves will ensure “fiscal stability,” Mills said in a news release.
Mills also pointed out that Maine is operating at 93 percent of its pre-pandemic economy, best in the nation according to an analysis by CNN and Moody’s financial services.
Mills said the state’s so-far successful efforts to minimize COVID-19 have led to an economy that’s in better shape than in most of the nation.
“We can’t have a healthy economy if we don’t have healthy people,” Mills said.
The University of New England announced additional testing measures on its Biddeford and Portland campuses Wednesday in response to the York County outbreaks.
UNE President James Herbert urged any students who may have put themselves at higher risk of contracting the virus by attending a party, religious services or other social event to go to the Student Health Center on either campus to be tested. Herbert said students would not be sanctioned for violating codes of student conduct in such situations.
Eleven UNE students previously had tested positive after an off-campus event that prompted a school investigation of student conduct."

Providence College issues stay-at-home order and will shift to full remote learning until at least Sept. 26
PROVIDENCE — The number of students testing positive for the coronavirus on and around the Providence College campus soared to 124 in just three days, and state health officials have opened case investigations and ramped up contract tracing to try to halt the spread.
Officials also are strongly urging all students who live in that area, and the employees of businesses that serve them, to be tested immediately.
The outbreak was first revealed when Providence College said late Thursday that it had issued a stay-at-home order to all students and will have full remote learning until at least Sept. 26 because 84 of its students had tested positive in just two days. Of those 84, 23 lived on campus and the rest rent apartments in neighborhoods near the school.
College president the Rev. Kenneth R. Sicard also ordered all on-campus students to stay on campus and off-campus students to self-quarantine in their apartments, to not hold any gatherings indoors or outdoors, and to stay away from bars, restaurants, clubs, and neighborhood businesses — or they will be suspended.
College staff, Providence police, and private security will monitor the off-campus apartments 24 hours a day, he said.
Sicard also raised the specter of classes not resuming at all, and the spring semester being canceled, if students do not follow the directives from the college and the state Department of Health.
“This is the biggest cluster of cases we have had in colleges and universities in Rhode Island,” Department of Health spokesman Joseph Wendelken said. “We spent a lot of time in the spring and summer focusing on nursing homes, and this highlights that there are challenges in all congregate living settings.”
All Providence College students are being tested, and the Health Department “strongly encouraged” all college students who live in the area and employees of businesses that interact with the students to be tested.
The Elmhurst area where many Providence College students live also houses students from nearby Johnson & Wales and Rhode Island College. A visit to the neighborhood Friday morning showed a plethora of delivery trucks, including from Stop & Shop, Amazon, and FedEx.
Testing of people without symptoms is done at the Rhode Island Convention Center. Appointments are required. To schedule an appointment, go to portal.ri.gov. Anyone who has symptoms should contact their doctor or a local health facility.
“We recognize how serious and difficult these directives are, but this is our last chance to remain together in person for the fall semester,” Sicard wrote in a letter to the Providence College community. “Between these actions and the serious steps we already have taken — especially in the past few days — we have used virtually every tool at our disposal. We are out of options. If we are not successful, we will have no alternative other than to shut down our campus for the remainder of the fall semester. This also will likely affect our ability to reopen for the spring semester.”
Steven J. Maurano, a spokesman for the college, said officials are trying to figure out how the outbreak began. He said the college has not had large gatherings like those seen at other places, such as Syracuse University. But officials are hearing that there might have been a gathering at an off-campus house of 30 or 40 people over the weekend.
“With this virus, that is all it takes,” he said. “But we don’t know for sure if that is ground zero.""
Maurano said it’s too early to focus on disciplining students. At this point, the emphasis is getting students into quarantine and isolation, he said.
While the majority of students who have tested positive live off campus, he said that 23 of the 84 students who tested positive live in Providence College residence halls. Other students included in the total of 124 tested positive at off-campus test sites, he said.
Maurano said it’s too soon to say if the college will stick with distance learning beyond Sept. 26. He said other colleges that had outbreaks went to remote instruction for two weeks before allowing students to return to classrooms. He said the college will have a better idea of how to proceed after testing of students is completed next week.
Maurano said he does not think it was a mistake to bring students back to start the fall semester.
“The numbers were pretty good until the middle of this week,” he said. “The large majority of students were and are complying with all the mandates and guidelines. But this virus is pretty insidious. If you have one gathering where someone is positive — boom — all of a sudden you can have 30 or 40 positive cases, and they pass it to their contacts.”
Providence City Councilman David A. Salvatore said that when he drove to work Friday morning he saw red and blue Solo cups scattered along Eaton Street — a telltale sign of off-campus student partying. Also, he said constituents have reported students moving around the area without face masks.
“There seems to be a culture of defiance among some students in the Providence College community,” Salvatore said.
Salvatore, who represents the city’s Elmhurst and Wanskuck neighborhoods, said the outbreak endangers residents who live near the campus.
“I commend Providence College for the increased level of communication,” he said. “But they can’t police every student 24/7. At some point, ownership falls on the students who are visiting Rhode Island for their college experience to adhere to the expectations. This has to be taken seriously.”
Providence College students have faced previous criticism during the pandemic. In May, Providence City Councilwoman Kat Kerwin said she received multiple calls from people who said they “witnessed reckless partying on Eaton Street,” near the college. At the time, the state had an order in place limiting social gatherings to no more than five people.
In August, college officials suspended 17 students for violating the school’s coronavirus code of conduct.
Brian Donohue-Lynch, who lives near the campus in the Elmhurst neighborhood, said the students and residents of the surrounding area go to the same places — such as the LaSalle Bakery, Shaw’s supermarket, and Dunkin' Donuts — and they rely on the same pizza delivery and supermarket delivery services.
So it’s not as if the students are living in some kind of bubble that would protect neighbors, he said.
“These are students who are integrated in their neighborhoods,” Donohue-Lynch said. “So to see that there is an outbreak among Providence College students means it’s a hotspot in our neighborhood that affects all of us.”
Holly Taylor Coolman, a professor at the college who lives near campus, said it’s important to take the virus seriously, but she acknowledged that she does want students to learn on campus.
“Most of us are still hopeful that there is a chance we can stay on campus and learn together as a community,” Coolman said. “That said, it is not easy to adopt new protocols that feel awkward. And we have to take the virus seriously. We may have to accept that this just won’t work.”

The C.D.C. reverses its guidance on testing for people who were exposed to the virus and aren’t showing symptoms.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday reversed a recommendation that people who have had close contact with someone infected with the coronavirus did not need to get tested unless they had symptoms.
The change came after widespread criticism of the earlier guideline, as well as reporting from The New York Times that the recommendation had come from political appointees in the Trump administration and skipped the agency’s usual, rigorous scientific review.
The Times reported Thursday that the guideline was posted on the C.D.C. website despite strenuous objections from the agency’s scientists.
The previous phrasing, which said asymptomatic people who have had close contact with an infected individual “do not necessarily need a test,” now clearly instructs them: “You need a test.”
Public health experts welcomed the change as consistent with research showing that people without symptoms can spread the virus. Some research has suggested that they are actually most likely to transmit to others starting around a day before the onset of symptoms, when the viral load can be the highest.
“It’s good to see science and evidence taking a front seat for a change,” said Scott Becker, chief executive of the Association of Public Health Laboratories.
The original guidance, posted on Aug. 24, drew sharp criticism even from the C.D.C.’s partners, including the Infectious Diseases Society of America, which urged its members to continue testing people without symptoms.
Emails by a former top Trump health official and his science adviser show efforts to silence the C.D.C.
Emails obtained by The Times illustrate how a top Trump health official and his science adviser tried to browbeat career officials at C.D.C. at the height of the pandemic, challenging the science behind their public statements and trying to silence agency staff members.
The Times reported last week on pressures on the C.D.C. to change its weekly disease reports exerted by Michael R. Caputo, a former Trump campaign official installed by the White House in April as the top spokesman for the Health and Human Services Department, and his science adviser, Dr. Paul Alexander, a part-time assistant professor of health research methods. Mr. Caputo went on medical leave this week.
The emails, obtained by Noah Weiland of The Times, conform with what current and former C.D.C. officials called a five-month campaign of bullying.
One of the emails was written after Dr. Anne Schuchat, a 32-year veteran of the C.D.C., appealed to Americans to wear masks and warned, “We have way too much virus across the country.”
“She is duplicitous,” Dr. Alexander wrote to Mr. Caputo. He asked Mr. Caputo to “remind” Dr. Schuchat that during the H1N1 swine flu outbreak in 2009, thousands of Americans had died “under her work.”
Of Dr. Schuchat’s assessment of Covid-19’s dangers, Dr. Alexander fumed, wrongly, “The risk of death in children 0-19 years of age is basically 0 (zero) … PERIOD … she has lied.”

Mr. Caputo forwarded that assessment to Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the C.D.C. director. When a member of the health department’s White House liaison office called the agency to ask questions about Dr. Schuchat’s biography, C.D.C. officials were left with the impression that some in Washington could have been searching for ways to fire her.
Far from hiding what they knew about the virus’s danger, as Bob Woodward’s new book contends President Trump was doing, the emails seem to indicate that aides in Washington were convinced of their own rosy prognostications, even as coronavirus cases were shooting skyward.
Trump acknowledged that distribution of an authorized vaccine for ‘every American’ may not be until next year.
Mr. Trump sought on Friday to recalibrate his assurances on vaccine availability, acknowledging that authorized doses might not be widely available in the United States until next spring even if distribution starts earlier.
Speaking at the White House, Mr. Trump said that once a vaccine is authorized, “distribution will begin within 24 hours after notice.” He added: “We will have manufactured at least 100 million vaccine doses before the end of the year. And likely much more than that. Hundreds of millions of doses will be available every month, and we expect to have enough vaccines for every American by April.”
The president had said earlier that a vaccine would be available to “the general public immediately” once it is authorized, and although he held firm on that pledge, he acknowledged that it would take perhaps months from that point to distribute vaccines to hundreds of millions of Americans.
Because of fears that Mr. Trump would interfere in the process to improve his election chances and pressure the Food and Drug Administration to approve a vaccine before it was proved safe, the chief executives of all the leading pharmaceutical companies signed a pledge two weeks ago saying they would not release any vaccines until they were sure they were safe.
Opinion polls have shown that many Americans are already hesitant about taking a vaccine that is seen to have been rushed to market by the federal government for political reasons.
Mr. Trump’s estimates of how many vaccine doses would be available this year conflicted with projections by the chief science adviser for his administration’s Operation Warp Speed effort, Moncef M. Slaoui, a former chairman of global vaccines for GlaxoSmithKline and a widely respected figure in the vaccine field. He and other leaders of Warp Speed were present at Friday’s news conference but not asked to comment.
In interviews with CNN and National Public Radio, Dr. Slaoui has said he expected only enough vaccine to immunize 20 million to 25 million people by year’s end. Enough to vaccinate all Americans would be ready by about the middle of next year, he said.
Dr. Slaoui has publicly said he would resign if there was political interference in the process of delivering a safe, effective vaccine.
Iran is a virus ‘red zone,’ a health minister says.
Iranian health officials warned for weeks that the country would see another wave of the virus if schools reopened and religious ceremonies proceeded. But the government ignored their advice, instead allowing crowds to gather for the Shiite ceremony of Ashura, universities to resume classes and a million students to sit for an indoor college entrance exam.
“We consider the entire country in the state of alarm and a red zone,” said Iran’s deputy health minister, Iraj Harirchi, in an interview on state television Friday. (Iran has defined a red zone as a place with an alarming increase in the number of deaths, new cases and hospitalizations.)
In February, during the earliest weeks of the pandemic, Iran emerged as a global hot spot, but the country’s health ministers initially denied the severity of the outbreak. Officials have repeatedly resisted the harsh shutdowns and quarantines enacted by other countries to curb the spread of the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani has said that Iranians must find a way to coexist with the virus and that shutting down businesses, schools and religious ceremonies was not feasible. And from the start, power struggles between the president and the military have hampered the country’s response.
On Friday, the health ministry said 144 people had died and 3,049 had tested positive for the virus in the past 24 hours.
An infectious-disease doctor at the main coronavirus hospital in Tehran posted a video on Instagram saying his hospital’s Covid-19 emergency triage team had seen over 200 patients a day in the past week, many of them students and teachers. He warned that at this pace, the country would soon face a crisis as hospital and medical staff members become overstretched and beds unavailable for new patients.
Global roundup
Boris Johnson, confirming that Britain is in its second wave, raises the possibility of a new lockdown.
Roughly 10 million people in England face new virus restrictions amid a spike in new cases. The country’s once-vaunted testing system is on the verge of collapse. And Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain is contemplating closing restaurants and pubs to corral a second surge in Europe’s worst-affected country.
Mr. Johnson is also facing rising anger over his contradictory edicts. Over the summer, he offered people a government-subsidized discount at restaurants and pubs but spoke bluntly on Friday about the virus advancing across Britain.
“There’s no question, as I’ve said for several weeks now, that we could expect and we are now seeing a second wave coming in,” Mr. Johnson said in a television interview. “I don’t think anybody wants to go into a second lockdown, but clearly when you look at what is happening, you’ve got to wonder whether we need to go further than” the new law forbidding gatherings of more than six.
“It does seem ironic,” said Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, “after encouraging mass attendance at pubs, cafes and restaurants,” that restrictions on those activities were being considered.
The R number, a measure of how many people on average a single patient will infect, rose to between 1.1 and 1.4, the government said on Friday. Any number over 1 is a worrisome indication that the epidemic is growing.
In the week ending Sept. 10, there were roughly 6,000 new daily cases outside hospitals and nursing homes in England, the government’s official statistics authority estimated, nearly a doubling from the week before.
In other news from around the world:
More than 30 million cases have been reported worldwide as of Friday morning, according to a New York Times database. India, in particular, has recently contributed significantly to the count, having added more than 93,000 new cases a day on average over the last week.
President Alejandro Giammattei of Guatemala said Friday that he had tested positive for the virus, becoming at least the fourth Latin American leader to be infected during the pandemic. In a video address, the president said he was in stable condition and continuing to work. More than 3,000 people have died from the virus in Guatemala. The country’s pandemic response has been hindered by widespread poverty, proximity to hard-hit Mexico and the Trump administration’s decision to continue deporting Guatemalan migrants, despite the high positivity rates among the returnees.
Thousands of Hasidic pilgrims who set out to celebrate the Jewish New Year at the grave in Ukraine of a revered rabbi started heading home on Friday, after being prevented from entering from Belarus due to virus travel restrictions.
New Zealand recorded no new cases of the virus on Friday for the first time in more than a month, after an outbreak in Auckland in August threatened the progress against the virus. The country now has just 70 active cases. Of those, 37 are from community transmission and the rest are from overseas arrivals.
Sciences Po, one of France’s most prestigious universities, is closing its Paris campus for 14 days after a significant number of students tested positive for the virus. Classes will be held online. And Nice, the country’s fifth-largest city, banned social gatherings of more than 10 people in parks, gardens and beaches to try to slow the spread of the virus. Cases have surpassed 50 per 100,000 people in Nice, where a third of the residents are considered elderly. The sale and consumption of alcohol is also forbidden after 8 p.m. and bars will have to close at 12:30 a.m. Bordeaux and Marseille are facing similar rules.
President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines has extended a national state of emergency until September 2021. Last month, the Philippine Congress extended Mr. Duterte’s emergency powers to address the pandemic, and it passed legislation allocating support for low-income households and people who lost their jobs because of the crisis.
A repeatedly extended ban on nonessential travel between the United States and Canada and the United States and Mexico that was set to expire Sept. 21 has been extended again, to Oct. 21, according to the Department of Homeland Security. However, Mr. Trump, speaking to reporters in Washington on Friday, said he was working to open the border with Canada “pretty soon.”
China’s CanSino Biologics and a military-backed research institute are preparing to start clinical trials of a two-dose vaccine regimen after scientists raised concerns that their current one-dose treatment failed to produce a strong enough immune response. The vaccine was promoted by Chinese state media as a front-runner in the vaccine race but struggled to get Phase 3 trials started in Canada.
U.S. ROUNDUP
Early voting kicks off in four U.S. states.
Early voting began in earnest Friday in four states: Virginia, South Dakota, Wyoming and Minnesota, a key Midwestern battleground that both candidates visited.
With the pandemic limiting indoor gatherings, elections administrators have urged voters to cast ballots either by mail or in person before Election Day. States have already seen record numbers of absentee ballot requests, and officials expect exceptional levels of voter participation before Nov. 3.
At a municipal voting center in northeast Minneapolis, voters waited 30 to 40 minutes in a line that snaked through an office park near Interstate 35W. The familiar “I Voted” stickers were replaced with a more precise “I Voted Early” model.
Darcy Berglund of Minneapolis said she had voted the first day that polls were open because she often travels back and forth to Iowa to care for her ailing mother.
“If she really takes a turn Nov. 2, I won’t be coming up here,” said Ms. Berglund, 60. “Even if I were in town, I’m so worried about this election. I just wanted to make sure I got my vote in.”
In most places in states that allow in-person early voting, it means going to a City Hall or a local board of elections, though some larger jurisdictions will arrange for regional early vote centers. The pandemic has brought even larger early-vote locations, with some major league sports franchises opening their vacant arenas and stadiums.
Elsewhere in the U.S.:
People in Mississippi who have health conditions that might put them at higher risk of severe illness from the virus are not automatically permitted to vote absentee under the state’s current law, the state Supreme Court ruled on Friday.
Six members of a team directing the firefighting efforts in the Pacific Northwest went into temporary quarantine after a member of a resupply crew tested positive, the authorities said. The test result, which led to a shutdown of a command post in Washington State for about an hour on Thursday, came amid longstanding worries about the current hazards of sending thousands of firefighters into close-quarter operations.
California’s Department of Public Health has recalled more than 10 million N95 respirator masks after learning they had not cleared a national certification process, but the state’s stockpile still has “a more than sufficient supply,” according to a spokesman for the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services. More than seven million of the masks had already been distributed to frontline workers, and the recipients have been notified. The masks were manufactured by Advoque Safeguard, a company in Santa Clara.
Democrats and White House officials neared a deal on Friday on a stopgap spending bill to keep the government funded through Dec. 11, according to two people familiar with the plans, but the agreement remained unfinished amid a last-minute dispute over funding that Mr. Trump demanded for farmers.
Education Roundup
After weeks with little data, more U.S. states begin to share information on cases in schools.
As millions of American students have returned to school across the country in recent weeks, cases have forced quarantines and shutdowns, and a few states, including Texas and Ohio, have rolled out online dashboards to track cases in schools.
Determining the impact of school openings on the broader trajectory of the pandemic has been difficult as reporting from states and districts has been spotty and inconsistent, with officials in some places refusing to reveal case numbers.
The number of cases reported by schools will almost certainly be an undercount, experts say, because children in particular are likely to be asymptomatic when carrying the virus, and are unlikely to be tested in the absence of symptoms.
In other education news:
A high school student in Attleboro, Mass., went to the first day of in-person classes on Monday despite testing positive days earlier. Roughly 30 people at Attleboro High School who came into contact with the student are now in quarantine. Attleboro’s mayor said that the student’s parents knew he had tested positive when they sent him to school.
Police in Mitchell, S.D., removed a man from a school board meeting for refusing to put on a mask in violation of district policy. Several speakers later criticized the mask mandate and asked why parents had not been surveyed about whether they supported it. “A survey wouldn’t change my mind,” one member of the school board said.
Because of virus-related precautions, Baylor University has postponed its football season opener scheduled for Saturday against the University of Houston. The matchup was hastily arranged last week to fill a void after each team’s original season-opening opponent had to cancel because of unmet standards for playing during the pandemic. More than a dozen football games at the elite F.B.S. level have been canceled or postponed in the first three weeks of the season.
Northeastern University in Boston has agreed to refund most of the fall semester tuition of 11 first-year students who were dismissed earlier this month for violating the school’s virus rules by gathering in a room without masks or social distancing.
More than 1,000 students and employees at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., have been instructed to quarantine, according to the school’s virus dashboard.
NEW YORK ROUNDUP
A pandemic surcharge on N.Y.C. restaurant checks? Some owners are wary.
New York City will soon let restaurants add a temporary charge of up to 10 percent as help in the pandemic, (though not for takeout or delivery), as long as it is clearly noted on menus.
The charge, which comes before tax, will be allowed until 90 days after the date, yet to be determined, when indoor dining is fully restored. (Indoor dining resumes on Sept. 30 at only 25 percent capacity.)
But in interviews, many restaurant owners said they weren’t ready to add the new surcharge, especially at the full 10 percent.
A growing group of restaurateurs and activists urging the City Council to add some restrictions to the surcharge that will improve conditions for workers, such as limiting it to restaurants that pay their entire staff, including servers, at least the full city minimum wage or above, as he does.
Elsewhere in the area:
New York City’s indoor pools will be allowed to reopen on Sept. 30, the mayor said Friday, so long as they do not exceed 33 percent capacity and follow all other city and state guidelines. Saunas, steam rooms and indoor spa pools in gym facilities remain closed.
Mask compliance has been generally high in most indoor settings in New York City, but confrontations have been playing out on buses, and dozens of drivers have been attacked after trying to enforce the rules.
The state’s Department of Motor Vehicles is expanding online services, the governor said Friday. A pilot program will offer digital written tests for learners’ permits for passenger cars and motorcycles. Another pilot program will allow residents of counties with state-run D.M.V. offices to register their vehicles.
A lockdown in Israel transforms celebrations for the Jewish high holidays.
As Israelis prepare to celebrate the holiest days on the Jewish calendar under a new lockdown, organizing prayer services is proving to be more of a mathematical brainteaser than a spiritual exercise.
Rabbis must arrange worshipers into clusters of 20 to 50, separated by dividers, determining the size of the groups based on complex calculations involving local infection rates, and how many entrances and square feet their synagogues have. Masks will be required, and many seats will have to remain empty.
With the virus rampaging again, Israel became one of the few places in the world to go into a second lockdown. The rules took effect on Friday, on the eve of Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year.
The government has issued a list of restrictions — along with a plethora of exemptions that many criticize as a formula for confusion and noncompliance.
The atmosphere in the run-up to the holidays was more despairing than joyous.
“These are not the holidays we were hoping for,” said Rabbi Kenneth Brander, the president of Ohr Torah Stone, an Israel-based Jewish education group with emissaries around the world. “The fragility of life is upon us, but I see people rising to the occasion.”
The three-week national lockdown was timed to coincide with the Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur holy days and the festival of Sukkot, in the hope of causing less economic damage because business slows down in any case around the holidays. It was also aimed at preventing large family meals that could become petri dishes for the virus.
Israel successfully limited the spread of the virus in the spring, but the number of cases, when adjusted for population, has risen to among the highest in the world. The country has had more than 300 confirmed new cases per 100,000 people over the last week — more than double the rate in Spain, the hardest-hit European country, and quadruple that of the United States.

Meanwhile, Brown University reported two positive cases this week.
Between Aug. 23 and Thursday, Brown has conducted 25,401 tests on 6,095 people. The school reported 15 have been positive.
At the University of Rhode Island, the school’s COVID Tracker reports: 1,350 tests performed between Sept. 10 and 17, with 41 positive, for a 3% positive rate.
The Rhode Island School of Design says it has conducted 2,776 tests between Aug. 12 and Thursday, with just three positive cases.
Roger Williams University reports that between Aug. 3 and Sept. 17, it has performed 30,544 tests on 5,175 different people on campus. Fifteen tests were positive and 803 are still being processed. Over the last seven days, the positivity rate at Roger Williams has been 0.04%.
Salve Regina University says it has tested 153 students, faculty and staff members over the last seven days; just one student has tested positive.
Rhode Island College and Johnson & Wales University websites did not offer detailed breakdowns on test results.
A RIC spokesman, however, said the college had 10 positive test results between Aug. 29 and yesterday. The school’s website reported one positive campus test since Sept. 8.
A spokesperson for Johnson & Wales reported no positive cases on the Providence campus between Sept. 8 and 14. The college will require testing this weekend for students who live in Providence’s Elmhurst neighborhood, home to Providence College.
Bryant University reported it had conducted 4,739 campus tests between Sept. 4 and 10. It did not report how many specific tests were positive but its website says the tests resulted in a seven-day positive average of 0.13%"

From March to mid-August, the town of 25,000 had recorded only 42 coronavirus cases.
But in the past month, that number has more than quintupled to 220 cases, with nearly all of those new cases reported from within the UConn student body. In a bid to contain the spread, an entire dorm was locked down, then a bar was shuttered. Now an off-campus apartment complex in Storrs Center is under quarantine.
A month after many Connecticut college students returned to school, COVID-19 cases at UConn and some other university campuses have played a significant role in the state’s recent uptick in coronavirus infections — a development many feared with the resumption of classes.
Gov. Ned Lamont Thursday noted “concerning” trends in Connecticut’s COVID-19 numbers, as the state’s rate of positive tests ticked up and the number of hospitalized patients climbed to its highest level in more than two months.
“There’s been a number of cases at UConn, there’s been some at Central,” the state’s chief operating officer, Josh Geballe, said Thursday as he discussed the state’s recent rise in COVID-19 cases and rate of positive cases. “Those seem contained at this point — I think the administrations there have taken all the right actions — but those do drive case numbers.”
But the experience has differed from one campus to the next, and from one college town to another.
In Mansfield, significant coronavirus outbreaks at UConn have yet to spill over into the broader community. But in New Britain, cases among Central Connecticut State students help explain a recent uptick citywide. In Middletown, New Haven and elsewhere, cases have remained low on local campuses, resulting in no apparent spike in cases. And in Windham, the town has recorded an uptick in coronavirus cases even while Eastern Connecticut State has seen a relatively low number of cases.
Due in part to wide variations in testing standards from school to school, the return to college campuses in Connecticut has resulted in a patchwork of issues — met by a similar patchwork of solutions.
Concern over community spread
Statewide, after weeks of positive test rates below the gold standard of 1 percent, Connecticut has seen its positivity rate climb over the past week and a half, while hospitalizations have reached higher levels than recorded since July.
Those increases have coincided with the reopening of college campuses. And while returning college students certainly do not account for the entirety of the state’s increased numbers, the cases identified among university students and staff have undoubtedly contributed to the Connecticut’s coronavirus uptick.
UConn’s cases have nearly singlehandedly pushed Tolland County into one of the highest per capita infection rates in the state. From Aug. 14 to Sept. 17, Tolland County reported 233 new coronavirus cases — in about the same time period, UConn reported well over 250 cases, although some of those cases were likely reported in students' hometowns outside of Tolland County.
Before UConn students returned to campus, local officials worried that coronavirus-positive students — particularly those who were asymptomatic — would bring the virus into Mansfield and then spread it to year-round residents, including elderly residents.
That concern drove Mansfield officials to push for additional restrictions on gatherings within the town. Mansfield officials, along with officials from Windham and West Hartford, lobbied the state for approval to decrease the maximum size of gatherings allowed, but Lamont’s administration never formally responded to that request.
However, so far Mansfield’s fears haven’t materialized. The town hasn’t seen significant COVID-19 spread spilling over from the UConn campus, according to Eastern Highlands Health Director Robert Miller.
“We’re seeing a very low prevalence of cases among Mansfield residents,” Miller said. “We’re not seeing any indication, based on the current data, that there’s an increased risk of spread among [the] non-student population in the Mansfield area.”
CCSU, meanwhile, has seen 19 cases among residential students and staff over the past week and currently has 15 students in isolation and another 15 under supervision in quarantine. In total, CCSU has recorded more than 60 cases among students, faculty and staff since reopening its campus in mid-August, behind only UConn among Connecticut colleges that have reported numbers regularly.
Unlike UConn, CCSU has been part of a broader uptick in its surrounding community, as cases have risen in New Britain. The city has recorded more than 100 cases over the past two weeks, according to state numbers, and had the second most cases of any Connecticut municipality between August 30 and September 12.
Sergio Lupo, the city’s health director said “there is a concern” about CCSU students who commute from surrounding towns or live off-campus in New Britain. He said health department officials were meeting with CCSU regularly to discuss containment strategy.
Early in the semester, CCSU President Zulma R. Toro threatened expulsions if students didn’t follow safety protocols. In early September, a popular bar new campus was shut down for two weeks after being linked to a cluster of cases.
Additionally, the school has increased the number of residential students tested regularly and offered one-time pop-up testing for students and faculty on campus. After initially testing 5-10% of students weekly, CCSU recently announced it would now test 25%, in hopes of catching more cases.
Elsewhere, Sacred Heart University has asked students living in Bridgeport to remain off campus due to a cluster of cases, while Connecticut College has sent home students following unsanctioned social gatherings.
In Windham, home to Eastern Connecticut State, COVID-19 numbers have spiked in recent days. After 330 cases over the first six months of the pandemic, Windham has reported more than 50 in the past two weeks.
ECSU itself has not seen a large number of coronavirus cases — one among on-campus students, six among commuter students — but the North Central District health director, Patrice Sulik, said the school may have played a role in the town’s cases.
“We are are seeing, as expected, activity from the Eastern students,"" Sulik said. ""And we’re working really closely with the college and the public school system and others to jump on it and nip it in the bud.”
Disparities in testing
Other college towns in Connecticut have not seen an increase in coronavirus cases.
Middletown, home to Wesleyan, and New Haven, home to Yale and other colleges, have both dodged outbreaks. Those campuses have also implemented aggressive testing programs, which may help at least in part to explain their low case numbers.
While many colleges and universities are only testing random samples of their student bodies or those with COVID-19 symptoms, Yale and Wesleyan have both committed to testing all students and staff every week. Officials say that allows them to catch cases early, before the virus has a chance to spread through the campus and town populations.
From September 9 to 15, Yale tested 4,931 students and 1,119 faculty and staff, discovering only three cases. The school has recorded 16 total cases since the start of August, according to its official dashboard.
Wesleyan has found similar success, testing 3,493 students and employees and finding only six total cases.
UConn has been testing less aggressively than Wesleyan and Yale, but still more than other state schools.
But even some schools with limited COVID-19 testing have so far avoided cases. In addition to Yale, New Haven’s other colleges — Southern Connecticut State and Albertus Magnus — have similarly kept their numbers low, despite less ambitious testing programs.
“We have a task force ready to respond but so far we have received zero complaints,” New Haven Health Director Maritza Bond said.
“There are inconsistencies across the state as to what each college is doing as far as testing and who is getting tested,” Bond said.
Other colleges that have largely avoided significant outbreaks include:
Trinity College, which has recorded 17 cases since mid-August, though 15 in the past two weeks.
The University of Hartford, which also has 17 total cases since August, as of Tuesday.
The University of New Haven, which has recorded two cases.
Fairfield University, which had seven total cases as of September 10.
The University of Bridgeport, which has recorded one case as of Tuesday.
Quinnipiac University, which has not yet recorded a positive test.

Utah crossed an unwanted milestone Friday: more than 1,000 new cases of COVID-19 in a day.
The Utah Department of Health reported the state had 1,117 new cases of COVID-19 on Friday, the most in a day since the pandemic began.
Gov. Gary Herbert called Friday’s tally “alarming. … We are clearly in an upward trend of cases.”
Herbert said, in a statement, that the state has issued numerous warnings to residents “to stay home if they are sick, and they need to stay away from others if they have tested positive for COVID-19.” He also reiterated his past calls to wear masks and maintain social distancing.
The spiking numbers, Herbert said, “make me seriously question if these warnings and public education are enough.”
Herbert said he would meet with his Unified Command leadership Monday. ""All of the tools that government has for controlling the spread of COVID-19 are on the table,” he said.
The state’s rolling seven-day average for new cases — the metric public health officials use to gauge trends — is at 726 cases per day. The average for the seven days before that was 402 per day.
Another 8,559 tests for the virus were processed in the past 24 hours, UDOH reported. The rolling seven-day rate of positive test results is at 12.5% — the fourth day in a row that statistic has set a record.
UDOH reported no new deaths from COVID-19, and the overall death toll remains at 437 people.
Since the pandemic began, 61,775 Utahns have tested positive for the coronavirus, out of 743,737 tested.
As of Friday, there were 131 people hospitalized in Utah with COVID-19, including 43 admitted since the previous day. Since the pandemic began, 3,444 Utahns have been hospitalized with COVID-19.
Utah County, the focal point for the current spike, recorded 501 new cases Friday, another one-day record. It’s also the most any regional health district in Utah has recorded during the pandemic.
Salt Lake County, with roughly twice as many residents as Utah County, had 393 new cases Friday.
Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall called the 1,117 new cases “staggering.” She said she’s spoken with Salt Lake County Mayor Jenny Wilson about enacting “meaningful restrictions"" to slow the case counts, which Mendenhall said could include asking Herbert to return the city to the medium-restriction level of “orange.”
On Sept. 4, the city moved to the lower “yellow"" level of restrictions, which means indoor public gatherings can include up to 50 people, though larger gatherings (such as concerts and sporting events) can go ahead if social-distancing precautions are in place in the seating areas. Under the “orange” guidelines, gatherings — indoor or outdoor — should be kept to 20 people or fewer.
1,117 new cases is staggering. What would be worse? Continuing to see Utah beat that number. And that’s where we’re headed if we don’t make a change now.
— SLC Mayor Erin Mendenhall (@slcmayor) September 18, 2020
For now, she is asking all Salt Lake City residents to take “great precautions in the days and weeks ahead.” This means wearing a mask, staying 6 feet away from others and reconsidering any social events that will include large gatherings.
“Nothing is more important than your health and the health of loved ones,” she said.
Earlier Friday, Utah County commissioners, along with mayors of the county’s major cities, conferred with Dr. Angela Dunn, the state epidemiologist, about the numbers — and brainstormed ideas about what to do about them.
“It was a wake-up call,” Tanner Ainge, chair of the Utah County Commission, said of Friday’s conference call.
One major data point Dunn delivered: The positivity rate for COVID-19 tests in Utah County has reached 21%, meaning 1 out of every 5 people tested for the coronavirus comes back with a positive result.
“The data clearly shows the level of urgency we need to have,” Ainge told The Salt Lake Tribune after the conference call. “I don’t have a sense yet for how many folks around the table are willing to have the county and cities act urgently to address this.”
One idea that was discussed, Ainge said, was to mount “positive campaigns,” to encourage Utah County residents — particularly students at Brigham Young University, where there have been 762 cumulative cases, and Utah Valley University, with 198 — to take steps to prevent spreading the virus. The problem, Ainge said, is such campaigns “cannot be developed on an urgent basis.”
Because the conference call happened without public notice, Ainge said, no votes were taken or decisions made. Ainge said officials will work through the weekend, and either the commission or the Utah County Council of Governments — which includes the commissioners and mayors in the county — could hold an emergency meeting as early as Monday.
The county could be forced into action by Herbert, who has the option to move Utah County — now in the low-restriction “yellow” level — back into the “orange” category.
“Action is inevitable here,” Ainge said of the governor. “He’s giving us an opportunity to act as local leaders.”
Herbert said he was “encouraged” by the discussions by Utah County officials, and was “glad to see them consulting with public health experts and treating this spike in cases seriously.”
Utah County Sheriff Mike Brown, who was on the conference call, issued a statement Friday afternoon, reiterating his previous declaration that if the county issues a mandatory mask order, “he will not be instructing deputies to enforce such orders through issuing citations.”
Instead, according to the statement, “it is his desire to combat this as a community. … He urges [Utah County residents] to use common sense and patience as we all work together to keep our community safe.”
Four new outbreaks and 31 new cases in public schools were reported in the past day. Since public schools began opening Aug. 13, there have been 56 outbreaks statewide, affecting 357 patients.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, there have been 402 patients infected in 67 school outbreaks, with a median age of 16. Eleven of those patients have been hospitalized; none has died."

222,https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid19-coronavirus-flu-season-fall,-4.4510000000000005,What will happen when COVID-19 and the flu collide this fall?,"The specter of a “twindemic” — two epidemics at the same time — looms as cold and flu season is set to start in October in the Northern Hemisphere. No one can predict what will happen when flu meets COVID-19, but public health officials are urging people to prepare for the worst.
In this case, the worst would be a bad year for influenza, which in the United States has killed 12,000 to 61,000 people annually and hospitalized between 140,000 and 810,000 each year since 2010, combined with a resurgence of coronavirus infections. Together, the two could stress health care and public health systems beyond their limits.
“We could see a perfect storm of accelerated COVID-19 activity as people gather more inside in particular, as they become increasingly fatigued with the mask wearing, social distancing and the hand hygiene, and as they are exposed to seasonal influenza,” said Jeanne Marrazzo, director of the infectious diseases division of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, during a news briefing from the Infectious Diseases Society of America, or IDSA, on September 10.
Some states are getting coronavirus spread under control, but hospitalization levels haven’t gone down much, she said. “Overall, we still are on … a razor’s edge when it comes to COVID,” and influenza remains unpredictable. “We really can’t be complacent about this.”
Infectious diseases experts worry about a conjunction of influenza and coronavirus for multiple reasons, beyond overburdened health systems. Teasing out whether a person has flu or coronavirus — which have very similar symptoms — will require testing for both viruses, at a time when turnaround for COVID-19 tests is often slow. And some people may get infected with multiple viruses simultaneously, which could make symptoms more severe.
But hints from the Southern Hemisphere give hope that the worst may not happen. Scientists usually forecast flu seasons’ severity in the north by watching what happens south of the equator, where flu season falls in the middle of the year. This year, the preview held good news: a mild season for flu and some other respiratory viruses.
Southern exposure
Countries in the Southern Hemisphere normally start seeing flu cases in May, and the flu season typically peaks in July and peters out around October. For the past five to six years, flu seasons in Australia have been bad. For instance, in 2019, Australia got an early flu season that started in March and “went on for a very long time,” says Kanta Subbarao, a virologist who directs the World Health Organization’s Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza at the Doherty Institute in Melbourne, Australia.
It wasn’t looking good for 2020 either. This year, flu season started even earlier, she says. “We started seeing some flu activity in January and February,” summer in the Southern Hemisphere. “Then it just completely stopped. It just fell off a cliff at the end of March, essentially when COVID-19 started appearing.”
From April through July, only 33 people had positive flu results in Australia out of 60,031 people tested, an international group of influenza researchers report September 18 in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The flu was also nearly nonexistent in South Africa and Chile in the late spring and early summer months. Together, the three countries recorded just 51 flu cases among 83,307 people tested, for a positivity rate of 0.06 percent. By contrast, over the April through July periods in 2017, 2018 and 2019, a total of 24,512 out of 178,690 people had positive flu tests, a positivity rate of 13.7 percent.
Flu review
The 2019–2020 flu season may have been cut short by public health measures to limit the spread of COVID-19. Compared with three previous flu seasons, the percent of flu tests that detected the virus dropped precipitously in March after the United States declared COVID-19 a national emergency. Some states had already instituted stay-at-home orders prior to the declaration. Surveillance for influenza typically starts at the end of September (around surveillance week 40) and continues until the beginning of April, though cases may occur year-round. These data go to early August (week 32).
Percent positive flu tests in the United States, 2016–2020
Travel restrictions that closed Australia’s borders may have prevented influenza from being imported from elsewhere. Lockdowns, school closures, mask wearing, social distancing and hand washing — all measures taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 — may have also quashed any influenza outbreaks that remained. Other Southern Hemisphere countries have also reported unexpectedly low levels of influenza and another common respiratory virus called respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, she says.
Public health officials anticipated a resurgence of influenza and RSV once Australia reopened schools, but that hasn’t happened, Subbarao says. “We have looked very long and hard,” but have found very little of either disease, Subbarao says. Instead, “what we’re finding is rhinovirus,” which cause colds, Subbarao says, suggesting that rhinovirus hasn’t been fazed by all the public health measures.
Northern predictions
Flu season may also be lighter than usual in the Northern Hemisphere as a result of reduced travel, former CDC director Tom Frieden said in an IDSA news briefing on September 15. Flu “gets around the world when people travel, and there’s not much traveling going on.” But COVID-19 remains a threat, he warned “If you doubted that COVID was more infectious than flu, look at South Africa or Chile, where COVID is spreading like wildfire and flu isn’t spreading at all.”
In the United States during the 2019–2020 flu season, flu cases also took a nose dive after public health measures were put in place to limit coronavirus spread. Flu cases started increasing in November 2019, and between December 15 and March 7, more than 20 percent of flu tests were coming back positive each week, according to the MMWR report. By the week of March 22, plenty of people were still getting flu tests, but only 2.3 percent of the results came back positive. Many of those influenza-like illnesses that weren’t due to flu may have been COVID-19 (SN: 6/25/20).
Since the week of April 5, fewer than 1 percent of flu tests have detected the virus, and off-season flu counts are at historical lows. From May 17 to August 8, only 0.2 percent of flu tests gave positive results, compared with 2.35 percent last year, 1.04 percent in 2018 and 2.36 percent in 2017. The sharp drop-off of flu cases might just have been the natural end of the flu season. However, the decrease in percent positivity after March 1 “was dramatic, suggesting other factors were at play,” the researchers wrote.
If social distancing and other measures to contain COVID-19 remain in place, the flu season in the United States might be blunted or delayed, the researchers wrote. But don’t bank on it, other experts say. If there’s anything experts who try to predict influenza activity have learned is that flu is unpredictable.
Battle for dominance
Predicting how flu will play with COVID-19 is trickier still.
Richard Webby, a virologist at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., is involved in efforts to predict which flu strains will dominate so that vaccines can be designed accordingly. One pattern Webby and other flu researchers have seen over and over again is that when a new pandemic influenza strain arises, it pushes out another strain. For instance, when the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic strain emerged, another H1N1 flu strain that had been circulating since 1977 disappeared.
SARS-CoV-2 — the virus that causes COVID-19 — and influenza will be competing for hosts to infect, which may result in one virus squeezing out the other, Webby says.
“I find it difficult to believe that there’s going to be widespread flu and widespread COVID activity at the same time. I think one of them will dominate. I couldn’t tell you which one it will be,” he says. Admittedly on the fence, he says that if asked to bet which disease will predominate, “I’d put a little bit of money each way.” He says the two diseases probably won’t both go gangbusters, “but I could easily be horribly wrong.”
Getting a double dose
In the battle for hosts, sometimes both viruses win, infecting a person at the same time.
As New York and New Jersey became hot spots of coronavirus spread in the spring, COVID-19 “patients were coming around the clock” to St. Joseph’s University Medical Center in Paterson, N.J., where Balraj Singh works. Singh, a hematologist and oncologist, was called in to treat the patients’ blood clots and plummeting blood cell counts. As he did so, he decided to also test his patients for infections with other viruses that produce similar symptoms. He and colleagues discovered that three of their patients were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza at the same time. They reported the cases August 18 in Cureus.
Two of the patients had to be intubated, but Singh and colleagues can’t say whether the dual infections made their illnesses worse. All were eventually discharged. It was important to publish the case reports “so somebody else can have a little bit of a head start” in recognizing that some people may have double trouble from viruses, he says.
Coinfections with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza will probably be uncommon, says David Morens, a virologist and infectious diseases doctor who is the senior scientific advisor to the director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md.
One analysis suggests only about 3 percent of COVID-19 patients were simultaneously infected with another virus, researchers reported online May 27 in the Journal of Infection. Those researchers examined 30 studies, mostly from China, that reported on dual infections with bacteria or viruses in people sick with COVID-19. The most common viruses to double up with SARS-CoV-2 were RSV and influenza A.
Broad defenses
It’s not impossible to catch viral infections at the same time or in quick succession, but getting one viral infection generally makes it harder to get another one, Morens says. That’s because viral infections tend to rev up the immune system’s generalized antiviral defense system, known as the innate immune system. Catching one virus sets off alarm bells in the form of virus-fighting immune chemicals known as interferons (SN: 8/6/20). For a short period after an infection, maybe weeks to months, the immune system stays on high alert with defenses at least partially raised to ward off any subsequent intruders.
That battening of the hatches against other viral invaders is different from the specific kind of immunity that comes from making antibodies against a particular virus. But it still might be useful. For instance, immunologist Ellen Foxman has long suspected that catching colds caused by rhinovirus may have delayed the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in Europe.
“For years I’ve been looking for a way to test” that idea, says Foxman, of Yale School of Medicine. She and colleagues confirmed that flu and rhinovirus don’t seem to mix by examining data from three later flu seasons, spanning November 2016 to March 2019. They found that people were less likely than expected to have dual infections with rhinovirus and influenza, the team reported September 4 in Lancet Microbe.
Infecting human lung cells growing in laboratory dishes provided some clues to why. First, the researchers infected the cells with rhinovirus. Then they tried a few days later to infect the same cells with flu virus. Rhinovirus infections turned up activity of genes involved in the interferon response, preventing flu viruses from replicating in rhinovirus-infected cells, the researchers found. Blocking interferon allowed the flu viruses to reproduce in cells already infected with the cold virus. But interferon response doesn’t last long, “maybe a week or two,” Foxman says.
And that type of protection isn’t perfect, Subbarao says. About 10 percent of the respiratory illnesses are coinfections with two or more viruses.
Some scientists theorize that vaccines against tuberculosis, measles or polio — which contain live, weakened virus or bacteria — might give some measure of protection against COVID-19 by generally toughening the immune system, Subbarao says. FluMist, a nasal spray flu vaccine mainly used for children, might also provide a little nonspecific armor against other viruses, though she cautions that the protection is short-lived and intended only as a stop-gap until there’s a safe, reliable and widely available coronavirus vaccine.
Injected flu vaccines are usually made with killed viruses and don’t offer the same generalized virus protection as live vaccines. But public health officials are urging people to get flu vaccines, to reduce the chances of getting infected with both viruses and hopefully ward off a nasty flu season.
“If there’s ever a year you need to get your flu shot, get your kids vaccinated, this is the year,” Marrazzo said."

Murphy says virus showing ‘ebbs and flows.’","New Jersey officials on Friday reported five more deaths attributed to the coronavirus and 519 new positive tests as Gov. Phil Murphy said COVID-19 has moved in “ebbs and flows” in recent weeks, with the state having “clocked some pretty big numbers” the past two days.
It was the fourth straight day the state has announced more than 400 new cases and the second straight day of more than 500 cases. The state reported 617 new positive tests on Thursday.
Meanwhile, officials Friday reported the state’s rate of transmission ticked up slightly for the second straight day, to 1.08, just above the key benchmark of 1 that shows the outbreak is expanding.
“The virus for us, at least in New Jersey, over the past number of weeks, if not months, has been what I would call undulating,” Murphy said during a television interview Friday morning on Fox 5′s “Good Day New York.” “It sort of ebbs and flows — as opposed to the big, massive upticks we saw in March and April.”
Despite the recent case upticks, coronavirus deaths and hospitalizations in the Garden State have remained relatively stable in recent weeks. Murphy also suggested part of the reason for the increased cases lately is an increase in testing, not outbreaks from gyms and indoor dining reopening two weeks ago.
Still, officials continue to warn about rising cases among younger residents, with 33% of the the state’s new cases Friday coming from those aged 18 to 29.
In addition, officials said have been notable case increases in Monmouth and Ocean over the last week.
All five the state’s newly reported deaths occurred in the last five days, Murphy said as he announced the updated figures at his latest coronavirus briefing in Trenton.
New Jersey, an early coronavirus hotspot, has reported 198,848 COVID-19 cases out of more than 3.29 million tests administered in the more than six months since the outbreak here started in early March. That’s the eighth most among U.S. states.
The state of 9 million people has reported 16,061 deaths related to the virus — 14,270 lab-confirmed and 1,791 considered probable — in that time. That’s the second most in the U.S. after New York. New Jersey has the nation’s highest COVID-19 death rate per 100,000 residents.
More than 34,500 residents have recovered from the illness, according to Johns Hopkins University, though that number is likely much larger.
New Jersey has seen its daily numbers drop significantly since April, when officials were routinely announcing hundreds of new deaths and thousands of new cases a day.
Murphy said in his TV interview that officials haven’t seen major spikes from gyms and indoor dining reopening.
“Nothing that we’ve seen as of yet,” the governor said on “Good Day New York” on Fox 5. “Our numbers are up a little bit over the past few days. I think that’s largely, not entirely, but largely due to the fact that we test per capita as much as any American state.”
State Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli said Friday the rise in cases lately is also because of gatherings — not just parties but “solemn” events like funerals.
“This increase in cases reminds us this virus is unrelenting,” Persichilli said. “It treats everyone the same. We are fighting an invisible enemy, and we must be cognizant of that fact.""
Because younger residents are less likely to suffer severe cases, officials said the increase in cases among young adults and adolescents is a part of the reason deaths and hospitalizations are staying stable. But officials warn young residents could still pass the virus more vulnerable people.
Plus, Persichilli said there were “very large” case increases in Ocean and Monmouth counties recently, accounting for 736 new positives over the last week. Ocean had 112 positive tests on Thursday and 93 on Friday (the most in the state), while Monmouth had 83 on Thursday and 51 on Friday (the second most).
“We cannot let our guard down,” Persichilli said.
“The fact we’re still seeing deaths and hospitalizations is still a concern,” added Dr. Christina Tan, the state epidemiologist.
TRANSMISSION RATE
New Jersey’s latest rate of transmission of 1.08 is up a tick from the 1.07 reported Thursday. It has been above 1 since Sept. 4 but stabilized earlier this week.
Any number above 1 means each newly infected person, on average, is spreading the virus to at least one other person. Any number below 1 means the virus is decreasing.
“With the big number of positives (lately), that number is bound to go up a little bit,” Murphy said at his briefing. “We want to get that under 1.”
The state’s latest daily positivity rate — the percentage of residents who test positive in a single day — was 2.19% on Sept. 13, the date with the most recent available data. That means slightly less than 98% of residents tested that day were negative.
HOSPITALIZATIONS
There were 413 patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases across New Jersey’s 71 hospitals Thursday night. That’s 18 fewer patients than the night before.
Of those patients, 221 tested positive for the virus and 192 were under investigation while awaiting test results. Many of of the people under investigation for the virus turn out to be negative, officials have said.
Thursday’s hospitalizations include 73 patients in critical or intensive care (12 fewer than the day before) with 36 on ventilators (four fewer than the day before).
There were 26 coronavirus patients discharged Thursday, according to the state’s coronavirus tracking website.
New Jersey’s COVID-19 hospitalizations have dropped dramatically since the state’s peak in mid-April, when there were more than 8,000 patients.

AGE BREAKDOWN
Broken down by age, those 30 to 49 years old make up the largest percentage of New Jersey residents that have caught the virus (31.1%), followed by those 50-64 (26.7%), 18-29 (15.8%), 65-79 (13.4%), 80 and older (9.3%), 5-17 (2.9%), and 0-4 (0.6%).
On average, the virus has been more deadly for older residents, especially those with pre-existing conditions. Nearly half the state’s COVID-19 deaths have been of residents 80 and older (47.1%), followed by those 65-79 (32.3%), 50-64 (15.9%), 30-49 (4.3%), 18-25 (0.4%), 5-17 (0%), and 0-4 (0%).
At least 7,141 of the state’s COVID-19 deaths have been of residents and staff members at nursing homes and other long-term care facilities.
Several school districts in New Jersey have been forced to change plans for in-person classes because students or staff have tested positive for COVID-19. But Murphy said this week he does not foresee having to close all schools and implement universal remote learning like he did the last academic year.
State officials are calling for residents to get flu shots to help avoid a possible “twin-demic” in the fall.
In addition, New Jersey is still calling on travelers from 30 states and territories that qualify as hotspots to voluntarily self-quarantine for 14 days after arriving. That includes residents returning home from a trip.
The number of deaths in New Jersey related to COVID-19 could surpass the 16,200 annual deaths from cancer the state has averaged — which would make the virus the state’s No. 2 killer, after heart disease, according to mortality data from the state Department of Health.
New Jersey has begun allowing some of the businesses listed in Stage 3 of its recovery plan to reopen with restrictions. Murphy has said he could tighten guidelines if there are sustained increases or if businesses and patrons don’t comply with the rules.
The virus has taken a major toll on the state’s economy. More than 1.56 million residents have filed for unemployment, businesses have lost untold revenue, and numerous businesses have closed permanently. In good news, weekly unemployment claims fell to a new low Thursday for the first time in five weeks.
GLOBAL NUMBERS
As of early Friday afternoon, there have been 30.25 million positive COVID-19 tests across the globe, according to a running tally by Johns Hopkins University. More than 947,200 people have died, while more than 20.57 million people have recovered.
The United States has the most positive tests in the world, at more than 6.68 million, and the most deaths, at more than 197,900.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention essentially returned to its previous testing guidance, getting rid of language posted last month that said people didn’t need to get tested if they didn’t feel sick. That change had set off a rash of criticism from health experts who couldn’t fathom why the nation’s top public health agency would say such a thing amid the pandemic.
It was “not consistent with the basic principles of controlling an epidemic,”said Dr. Silvia Chiang, a pediatric infectious diseases expert at Brown University who applauded the change announced Friday.
The CDC now says anyone who has been within 6 feet of an infected person for at least 15 minutes should get a test. In a statement, the agency called the changes a “clarification” that was needed “due to the significance of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission.”
This is the first year any Pennsylvania voter can vote by mail, and election law now also requires counties to provide mail ballots on demand to voters who request them in person. That allows for a kind of in-person early voting, and the Pennsylvania Department of State has encouraged counties to open satellite elections offices to make it easier for voters to vote early.

Israel, Spain and France all fought the coronavirus into abatement in the first months of the pandemic with tough measures that won international praise. But the three countries now share a painful distinction: their infection rates have shot past the United States, even though Americans never got the virus under control.
Israel now has one of the worst infection rates in the world given its population: Over the past week, it has reported an average of 47 cases per day per 100,000 residents. Spain, which has averaged 22 cases per day per 100,000 people, and France, which has averaged 13, have also been setting daily records.
Congress still hasn’t been able to come to an agreement regarding adding unemployment benefits to replace the $600 a week that expired at the end of July. The Trump administration’s $300 weekly benefit, the Lost Wages Assistance program, ended in Pennsylvania on Sept. 5, though residents who were unemployed prior to the cut-off and who meet the eligibility requirements can still apply on the state’s website.
Philadelphia: 536 new cases reported Sept. 9 to 15, a decrease of 9.9% compared to the previous week (though the city does warn some data may be delayed). Overall, 35,538 cases, at least 1,774 deaths.
Pennsylvania: 5,962 new cases reported from Sept. 10 to 16, an increase of 17.9% over the previous week. Overall, 147,923 cases, at least 7,913 deaths.
New Jersey: 2,761 cases reported from Sept. 9 to 15, an increase of 16.5% over the previous week. Overall, 198,361 cases, at least 16,045 deaths.
Delaware: 745 new cases reported from Sept. 10 to 16, an increase of 11.8% over the previous week. Overall, 19,318 cases, at least 619 deaths.

Lauren Tilghman, director of strategic communication for KenCrest, said the majority of its clients have underlying health conditions such as heart disease, stroke, or diabetes, which makes them more vulnerable to the coronavirus. In Pennsylvania, people with intellectual disabilities are nearly twice as likely to die from COVID-19 as other residents who test positive for the virus, according to an NPR analysis."
225,https://www.wearegreenbay.com/coronavirus/kewaunee-school-district-transitions-to-two-weeks-of-virtual-learning-due-to-increase-in-covid-19-cases/,1.778,Kewaunee School District transitions to two weeks of virtual learning due to increase in COVID-19 cases,"KEWAUNEE, Wis. (WFRV) – A Northeast Wisconsin school district will transit to virtual learning for two weeks after seeing a spike in coronavirus cases.
According to a letter sent to parents on Friday, the Kewaunee School District will move to virtual learning starting Monday, Sept. 21, and running through Friday, Oct. 2. School officials say the district will return to in-person learning on Monday, Oct. 5 “pending school and community metrics.”
“There are specific metrics that assist us in determining the learning model that should be in place district-wide. District administration analyzes data regularly, while also consulting with Cindy Kinnard, Kewaunee Public Health and Dr. Kristen Powell, KSD Medical Director, in regards to present data trends. Due to the amount of spread occurring in Kewaunee County and the impact to our students, staff, and families, we believe the most prudent decision is to go back into virtual learning,” the letter reads.
Officials report there are 104 active cases of COVID-19 in Kewaunee County and another 209 are pending. Within the school district, five staff members have positive cases of COVID-19 and seven staff members are quarantining.
There are 12 positive student cases of COVID-19 across the Kewaunee School District, with many of them coming in the last two days. There are 123 students in quarantine.
“Bottom line, today’s decision is based on the most current information that is available to the District,” says the letter.
School officials go on to say that the “decisions we all make when out in the community impact the District’s ability to keep students and staff at school for in-person learning.” They ask that parents and members of the community wear a mask, practice social distancing, avoid large group gatherings, and stay home when you or someone in the household is sick.
All athletic practices and games will be suspended during this time. The Kewaunee School District says these events will be postponed and rescheduled upon review of conference recommendations.
The district says they will continue to provide meal service to all of our students and children in the
community.
“We will continue to do everything we can to make our schools as safe as possible and to support
our students no matter the distance.”
A Catholic school in Kiel and the School District of Bonduel were among the first in the area to transition to virtual learning due to COVID-19.

This study, published last Thursday in the Journal of Medical Internet Research, found a statistically significant uptick in clinic and hospital visits by patients who reported respiratory illnesses as early as the week of December 22.
The researchers noticed this trend by looking through nearly 10 million medical records from the UCLA Health system, including three hospitals and 180 clinics.
The first known case of Covid-19 in the US was thought to be a patient in Washington who had visited Wuhan,China, according to the CDC. The 35-year-old patient first went to a clinic for symptoms on January 19, according to a report that ran in March in the New England Journal of Medicine. It wasn't until late February that the CDC detected the first cases of community spread, although the CDC later found evidence community transmission began in late February.
In China, the first known case of Covid-19 was in a person who developed symptoms on December 1, according to a study from the Lancet. That means the patient could have been exposed to the disease as early as November. A handful of ongoing studies have found some evidence that the virus may have been circulating in Europe in December, or earlier.
Dr. Joann Elmore, who worked on the new study, said she started looking through the records after receiving a number of emails from anxious patients in March through her clinic's patient portal at UCLA. Patients kept asking if the cough they had in January could have been Covid-19. The UCLA physician, who also trained as an epidemiologist, said she was curious, so she started this study.
Elmore and her colleagues noticed the spike in respiratory cases by searching the field in medical records that lists why someone came to the clinic and searched for the symptom ""cough."" They looked at the records for the month of December 2019 through February 2020 and compared their findings to records from the five prior years.
""With the outpatients, I found a 50% increase in the percentage of patients coming in complaining of a cough. It came out to over 1,000 extra patients above the average of what we would typically see,"" Elmore said.
The number of patient visits to the ER for respiratory complaints, as well as the number of people hospitalized with acute respiratory failure between December 2019 and February 2020, showed a similar increase compared to records from the past five years. The uptick in cases started in the final week of December.
""Some of these cases could have been due to the flu, some could be for other reasons, but to see these kinds of higher numbers even in the outpatient setting is notable,"" Elmore said.
While scientists may never know for sure if these excess patients were early Covid-19 cases, Elmore doesn't think it's out of the question.
""Our world is so interconnected. There are about 500 flights from China a month to LAX, so you could easily have one or two cases from that travel and it could get into the community,"" Elmore said.
Elmore hopes this research shows that real time data collected on diseases like this could potentially help public health experts identify and track emerging outbreaks much earlier and potentially slow or stop the spread of disease.
Dr. Claudia Hoyen, is an infectious disease specialist at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center who did not work on the study, also believes it's possible Covid-19 may have been in the US much sooner than first realized.
""Based on what we know of a few other studies and now this one, I think definitely this could be something,"" Hoyen said. ""It's certainly something that needs to be considered.""
Hoyen said the bigger takeaway from this study for her was that it points to the possibility that data like this could augment some of the disease surveillance the CDC is already doing for diseases like flu.
""Is there a way to mine the data in other ways that may have picked up on some of the other symptoms that people were presenting with, so we had a better understanding of disease sooner?"" Hoyen asked. ""Then maybe instead of a month into it, like when we were seeing a lot of patients complaining of loss of taste and smell, if we had analyzed the data beforehand, we may have picked up those kinds of symptoms much sooner.""
Kristian Andersen, a professor in the Department of Immunology and Microbiology at Scripps Research, doesn't believe Covid-19 is to blame for the rise in the number of patients with respiratory ailments in California in late December.
""We know from the SARS-CoV-2 genetic data that the pandemic started in late November / early December in China so there's absolutely no way the virus could have been spreading widely in December 2019. From the same genetic data we know that widespread transmission didn't start in the United States until (around) February 2020,"" Andersen said in an email.
""The paper is picking up spurious signals and the hospitalizations are more likely from flu or other respiratory diseases,"" Andersen wrote. ""Again, the genomic data clearly shows that there was no widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States in December of last year - there may have been a few sporadic cases, but that's it and certainly not something that would have been seen in 'excess hospitalizations.'""
Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo an infectious disease specialist who also was not involved in the study, disagrees. She thinks the conclusion, particularly since the study captures outpatient records, is persuasive.
""If we had more precise genetic phylogenetic data of the spread of the virus, I think that could be very interesting, but in the absence of that, you can do a lot of work by inferring some preexisting patterns from these types of analyses,"" said Marrazzo, the director of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine. ""Primary care data like this is useful and we really need to pay attention to it.""
""When you compare these numbers to previous years, there's no good explanation in my mind why all of the sudden you would see that dramatic increase in the records, except for Covid,"" Marrazzo said. ""Just the strength of the numbers of information, when you include the outpatient, it shows a pattern.""
Neither the CDC nor the WHO responded to CNN's request for perspective on the research or on the official time line of the pandemic.
Marrazzo said she and infectious disease colleagues across the country have been discussing how often they were seeing patients with what we now know as Covid-19 symptoms earlier than the official timeline. Because of the sharp restrictions the CDC placed on testing early in the pandemic, it was difficult to confirm if respiratory cases they were seeing were caused by coronavirus.
""I have no doubt that we all missed cases in the early part of the pandemic,"" Marrazzo said. ""This study offers a really interesting window into what might actually have been happening."""

The same day, Temple University in Philadelphia called it quits. So did Colorado College earlier in the week.
At the University of Alabama, 1,200 of 38,500 students are infected, and the University of South Carolina’s positive test rate topped 27%. Even the University of Illinois, one of the pioneers in saliva testing for students, had to beg them to stop partying and increased patrols after finding more than 700 positive cases since classes began.
Weeks into the academic year, colleges are hosting raging clusters of infections, crises that are both medical and political. Administrators are under intense pressure to keep schools functioning, providing a semblance of educational and athletic normality: President Donald Trump has said canceling football games would be a “tragic mistake.” But experts say that virus cases will inevitably emerge and could threaten surrounding communities.
“We’re really watching these mini-experiments happen all across the country,” said Brian Fisher, a researcher with the PolicyLab at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, which has been modeling the spread of COVID-19. “It remains to be seen for some campuses whether they’re going to get their outbreaks under control.”
Many schools sit amid hot spots, especially in the Midwest. The University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign, which has performed almost 200,000 tests on students, faculty and staff in twice-weekly screenings, warned Wednesday of a worrisome increase in virus cases.
Risky behavior by undergraduates was to blame, including partying and ignoring quarantine guidance, the university said. It is disciplining more than 100 students and several organizations.
“The irresponsible and downright dangerous actions of a small number of our students have created the very real possibility of ending an in-person semester,” Chancellor Robert Jones said Wednesday.
At Iowa State University in Ames, the positivity rate during the first week of classes, which started Aug. 17, was 13.6%. In the second week, it shot to 28.8% on the campus of more than 31,000 students.
Large parties and gatherings were the cause, President Wendy Wintersteen said in a statement. The university expanded testing and contact tracing, and enacted new requirements such as face coverings. Calls from the community also led Wintersteen to reverse course and not allow any fans to watch the home opener football game Sept. 12 in the stadium. The school had previously planned to allow 25,000 people, less than half the capacity.
At Ohio State University, President Kristina Johnson sent an email to the more than 60,000 students, faculty and staff Thursday urging them all to “act as though you are positive” going into Labor Day weekend.
Between Aug. 14 and Sept. 1, about 1.6% of the public flagship’s student population — 1,052 students — contracted the disease. Deans “can pretty much trace” the spread from party to party, and the ability of the university to provide in-person education will rely on students’ restraint, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said at a news conference.
“No one is telling students to hibernate for nine months or the whole year,” he said. “Look, this is the reality: If the numbers get too high and the spread is too much, these schools are going to have absolutely no choice but to pull back.”
As classroom doors close, some students are rushing home. Others are looking for off-campus housing. Many students, parents and administrators are frustrated.
After a flight from New York to Denver and a two-hour car ride, Laurie Meehan and her son Christopher, an 18-year-old freshman, arrived at Colorado College on Aug. 16. He and his two roommates tested negative upon arrival, but his dorm was quarantined Aug. 29. He was told this past week that students had to leave university housing by Sept. 20 and now, he’s quarantining alone in a triple room.
Christopher and his parents would like him to stay in Colorado and take advantage of the outdoor activities.
“He and a number of other students are trying to find housing,” said Laurie Meehan. “Some are looking in mountain towns because there are so many rental properties available.”
The reversals have been predictable, said Robert Kelchen, an associate professor of higher education at Seton Hall University in South Orange, N.J. “Colleges told their students most of the summer that things would be reasonably close to normal,” Kelchen said. “They expected college students to stay to themselves or in very small groups of friends. That’s not how the college experience works.”
In Tuscaloosa, University of Alabama students packed bars last month after sororities chose their members on their Bid Day, an annual spectacle that involves herds of undergraduate women racing and cheering before large crowds of onlookers.
A few days before students had returned Aug. 23, the school said only 237 of them had tested positive. The number is now more than 1,200. The university had 450 housing units reserved to quarantine students, but exceeded that capacity in less than a week.The school has received 400 reports of students breaking rules about masks and social distancing, and has removed several from class, according to a memo from President Stuart Bell. Officials haven’t suggested sending students home, saying that would spread the virus to their relatives and communities.
State schools in New York are investigating the spread of the virus on several campuses, including Plattsburgh, Cobleskill, Fredonia, and Buffalo.
Closing them, however, would hurt already-strained budgets, said Fred Kowal, president of United University Professions, the union representing State University of New York system employees. The 64-institution system lost as much as $1 billion after closing due to the virus during the spring semester and having to reimburse housing costs and fees, Kowal said.
“In this budget climate, in this economy, to be hemorrhaging hundreds of millions of dollars, let this be the understatement of the year: That’s unsustainable,” he said.
As a biochemist and virologist, Assistant Professor Ron Bishop was “cautiously pessimistic” about in-person classes at SUNY Oneonta this fall.
“I was one of the handful of people here who really wanted to have an in-person component to my courses,” said Bishop. “I love the lab and I have the most fun here with students in the lab. And so, I really, really wanted to keep that going as long as I could.”
But Bishop, whose research background includes working for the National Cancer Institute, was ready for things to go south quickly.
“This all looked like a pretty slow-moving train wreck to me,” he said.
Universities didn’t acknowledge the inevitable risk that college students take, said Gavin Yamey, a physician and professor of global health and public policy at Duke University in North Carolina.
“Shaming young people for risky behavior at a time when we know they are in young adulthood, when risk-taking is at its peak, is an ineffective public health strategy,” said Yamey, who directs Duke’s Center for Policy Impact in Global Health."

A University of Cincinnati dean is investigating an email to an engineering student in which an adjunct instructor is accused of referring to the novel coronavirus as ""the Chinese virus."" The email came after the student had to miss a lab session due to being quarantined for possible exposure to the novel coronavirus.
""I think that the school should take disciplinary actions against the professor because (his) actions completely violate the school's values,"" 20-year-old Evan Sotzing told The Enquirer Thursday evening.
University spokeswoman M.B. Reilly said Thursday night that the ""matter has already come to the attention of the dean who is already looking into this on behalf of the student.""
Sotzing said he has been in contact with UC's Dean of Engineering and Applied Science, John Weidner, who he says is ""looking into it.""
Weidner said he referred the matter for review to the university's Office of Equal Opportunity and Access. That department handles inquiries regarding discrimination, harassment or retaliation based on disability, race, color, religion, national origin and other identities, according to their website.
""These types of xenophobic comments and stigmatizations around location or ethnicity are more than troubling. We can better protect and care for all when we speak about COVID-19 with both accuracy and empathy – something we should all strive for,"" Weidner wrote to The Enquirer.
Sotzing received the email from John Ucker, who is listed as an adjunct instructor in UC's College of Engineering and Applied Science. He did not reply to an email from The Enquirer Thursday evening.
In emails forwarded to The Enquirer, Sotzing, a third-year engineering student, wrote to Ucker that he would not be able to attend an in-person lab scheduled for Tuesday because his girlfriend tested positive for the novel coronavirus at UC's University Health Services.
Sotzing was tested the same day, he said, and he received a negative COVID-19 result. However, Sotzing said the university's health officials told him to quarantine for two weeks because of his proximity to a positive patient.
Those tests were taken on Sept. 4, Sotzing said. The lab was scheduled for Tuesday, on Sept. 15, which would have fallen in the two-week quarantine time period.
Sotzing provided photo evidence of his test results in an email to Ucker, and wrote that he had been told not to attend any in-person classes until Thursday.
Ucker did not reply to Sotzing's email until after the in-person lab had already happened.
""For students testing positive for the chinese (sic) virus, I will give no grade,"" the email reads. ""You can read the info I sent to the class re: the torsion test.""
UC stated in its Return to Campus Guide that it encourages faculty to be flexible with students, especially in regards to attendance policies during the pandemic. Weidner said Ucker has a ""routine policy"" of allowing students to forego one of the lab tests so that a grade will not be recorded.
""I don't want to infect anyone else, if I do have it, but I also don't want to fail school,"" Sotzing said.
UC has reported 321 COVID-19 cases among students as of Thursday. Hamilton County officials said this week the positive rate for the new coronavirus is spiking in Cincinnati's Corryville, Mount Auburn and CUF (Clifton Heights/University Heights/Fairview) neighborhoods around UC.
Sotzing said he is not clear whether Ucker's message meant he was getting a zero grade or if the professor is merely not grading the assignment. He says he was offended by what he called ""racist language"" from Ucker in the email, and the notion that Ucker might punish a student for adhering to national, state and local health guidelines.
""This kind of language is completely unacceptable. And especially from people, like, in power... it has no place in this country and it contributes to Asian xenophobia,"" Sotzing said.
Sotzing posted the professor's email response on Twitter Thursday afternoon.
""My girlfriend tested positive for COVID and the University of Cincinnati's Health Department instructed me to not attend my in-person lab. Not only did my professor give me a zero for not going, but this was his response,"" the post reads, with a screenshot of the email.
Within three hours, the post had over 6,000 likes and over 2,000 retweets.
""He needs to apologize for the fact that he made that comment,"" Sotzing told The Enquirer Thursday.
News of the investigation came on the same day that the U.S. House of Representatives passed a measure condemning anti-Asian bigotry and discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Increased numbers of Asian Americans have reported harassment and even physical assaults amid political rhetoric blaming China for the pandemic from President Donald Trump and others.
The House measure, a nonbinding resolution, does not require the Senate to pass it, nor does it require the president’s signature
The Enquirer reached out to Reilly and asked for a comment regarding the professor's language, policies surrounding such language and policies surrounding accommodating students who test positive for COVID-19 or are exposed to the new virus.
She provided the following language from UC's Return to Campus Guide on university policy regarding COVID-19:
The university is committed to meeting the best interest of students while prioritizing their health and safety. In accordance with the Faculty Senate Resolution on Class Attendance and Participation during COVID-19, faculty are encouraged to be flexible with attendance policies and other aspects of supporting academic progress – particularly for students in isolation and quarantine.
Faculty are encouraged to think beyond traditional definitions of attendance and support and provide students with opportunities to make up missed work or do commensurate work. This will allow for a positive student learning experience and a commitment to delivering exemplary instruction. An incomplete grade may be awarded in the event of a student illness, which will provide an opportunity for a student to work with faculty to complete coursework after the semester concludes."

231,https://www.nbc26.com/news/local-news/uw-oshkosh-to-begin-testing-dorm-wastewater-for-covid-19,-0.26,UW Oshkosh to begin testing dorm wastewater for COVID-19,"OHSKOSH (NBC 26) -- The University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh will soon begin testing residence hall wastewater for COVID-19.
The school will use the Environmental Research and Innovation Center at the university to test for evidence of the virus. ERIC is a certified laboratory for both chemical and biological contaminants, the university says in a news release. The school says the lab already is testing sewage at a handful of local healthcare facilities for the same purpose.
“Wastewater testing has historically been a useful tool for the early detection of other diseases,” said ERIC lab manager Carmen Thiel. “Monitoring the dorm wastewater on the UW-Oshkosh campus for the presence of COVID-19 will assist University and Oshkosh area health officials in public health decision making, as COVID-19 can be shed in the feces of both symptomatic and asymptomatic people.”
UW-Oshkosh plans to begin testing wastewater the 10 residence halls shortly. The school says the test results will give UW-O officials a general idea of how much COVID-19 is in each residence hall, and swift action can then be taken if needed.
It’s not a strategy to find specifics on the number of cases in a building, the school says.
UW-O notes that other schools have conducted sewage testing for COVID-19, including UW-Madison. UW-O also cited claims from University of Arizona and University of Idaho, who say potential outbreaks were averted on their campuses due in part to wastewater testing."
232,https://www.wearegreenbay.com/coronavirus/uw-oshkosh-to-begin-testing-campus-wastewater-for-evidence-of-covid-19/,0.23099999999999993,UW Oshkosh to begin testing campus wastewater for evidence of COVID-19,"OSHKOSH, Wis. (WFRV) – UW Oshkosh will begin testing residence hall wastewater for evidence of coronavirus.
The university says the move is another effort to catch potential on-campus outbreaks of COVID-19 before they happen.
Wastewater will be regularly tested at the Environmental Research and Innovation Center (ERIC) at the UW Oshkosh campus.
“Wastewater testing has historically been a useful tool for the early detection of other diseases,” says ERIC lab manager Carmen Thiel. “Monitoring the dorm wastewater on the UW Oshkosh campus for the presence of COVID-19 will assist University and Oshkosh area health officials in public health decision making, as COVID-19 can be shed in the feces of both symptomatic and asymptomatic people.”
ERIC is a certified laboratory for both chemical and biological contaminants. The lab is already testing sewage at a handful of local healthcare facilities for the same purpose.
Wastewater testing of the 10 residence halls housing students this fall is planned to begin shortly. It’ll not only benefit the University, it could be a tool to prevent future spread in the Oshkosh community and beyond.
The results from the wastewater testing will be an additional piece of data available for UW Oshkosh officials keeping a close eye on the spread of COVID-19 among the UWO community.
“The results from the wastewater testing will be another way to monitor the prevalence of the virus on campus and, along with the daily testing, are another data point we can use to make decisions on how to continue to keep the UWO community safe,” says UWO Police Chief Kurt Leibold, chair of the Titans Return Implementation Team.
ERIC director and environmental engineering technology professor Greg Kleinheinz says these tests will give UWO officials a general idea of how much COVID-19 is in each residence hall, and swift action can then be taken if needed. It’s not a strategy to find specifics on the number of cases in a building.
“We’ll get a relative abundance—is it high, low, is there any?” Kleinheinz says. “That’ll help kind of drive what happens next. If all of a sudden after several tests with no virus, then a huge spike and a big number arrives, it won’t tell you how many people are infected but it can give you an indication that a number are, or just one or two.”
Tests will be run once or twice a week to start, according to Kleinheinz, but the plan is flexible moving forward. The ERIC lab will collect and process the samples, then send them off to a private lab for analysis. Results will be available within three days.
UW-Madison is also conducting these kinds of tests, Kleinheinz says.
The University of Arizona announced last month it likely prevented an outbreak in a residence hall thanks to an early red flag in wastewater and an immediate response of tests and quarantines. University of Idaho made a similar claim this week.
UW Oshkosh is reporting 240 active cases of COVID-19 on campus.

233,https://www.njspotlight.com/video/njit-detects-covid-19-in-sewage-quarantines-entire-dormitory/,-0.714,"NJIT detects COVID-19 in sewage, quarantines entire dormitory","Project engineers ran a pump to suck up sewage samples through a tube snaking down into a manhole. It’s tucked into the corner of a campus lawn at New Jersey Institute of Technology where they test sewage weekly for the coronavirus because people infected with COVID-19 excrete virus when they go to the bathroom. It’s a big red flag.
“It’s an early warning system because you’re shedding the virus before you would test positive for a sample of an individual,” said NJIT Executive Director of Environmental Health and Safety Mitchell Gayer.
“Positive people discharge the RNA mostly before they even know they’re positive. This is an early indicator, days ahead,” said Veronica Kero, president of Omega Environmental Services.
“The goal is to quickly identify when there is a positive case on campus, and isolate the individual or individuals who have that before there’s an opportunity for spread to occur,” said NJIT Chief Strategy Officer Matthew Golden.
The school monitored its sewage at seven sites on campus since classes started in September. On Sept. 16, NJIT got a red flag — a positive COVID-19 test in sewage from Cypress Hall, a dorm with 300 students. Cypress went into immediate lockdown.
“Yeah, they’re pretty upset about it because they don’t want to be stuck in their rooms all day,” said Matthew Dizon, a student who has friends in the dorm. “But it is what it is. You’ve got to do your best to keep people safe. I’m glad that NJIT’s doing their best to test for things.”
“These are likely asymptomatic individuals, and if we had no wastewater testing in place, they could potentially be spreading the virus within the residence hall or within the campus community unchecked,” said Golden.
Every Cypress Hall resident immediately got tested for COVID-19 to find who could be infected. No one’s showing symptoms. Administrators alerted the entire campus.
“I’m a little paranoid about the corona stuff, but it helps me feel safer to come in knowing that they’re taking the testing seriously and they’re taking the steps to test immediately the moment they find something out that’s wrong,” said student Santiago Ovalles.
“We know that it’s going to be safer. Instead of like some schools they really don’t test that often and they don’t take it seriously like here,” said student Manuela Estella-Gomez.
NJIT is in downtown Newark, so every week the school tests 400 students, faculty and staff at random for COVID-19. So far, they’ve gotten three positives that way. But testing the sewage allows them to cast a wider net for the virus.
NJIT’s sewage collection sites focus on distinct residential groups.
“Each site represents a dormitory and these are the greek houses over here. So these smaller houses, we test them all at once,” said Gayer.
Professor Lucia Rodriguez-Freire suggested NJIT test sewage for COVID-19 noting similar virus surveillance programs exist at several universities, more than 40 states, the Netherlands, Finland and Spain.
“The good thing about it is, we don’t have to test individuals. We can test the whole community, and see if something is going on,” said Rodriguez-Freire.
Dr. Martin Blaser, director of theCenter for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine at Rutgers University, explains testing sewage lets public health officials scale up COVID-19 surveillance to entire city sewage systems where engineers can trace positives to identify hot spots.
“Everybody has to go to the bathroom, so you can test sewage so that you can test a whole dormitory, or you can test a whole campus, or you can test a whole factory,” said Blaser. “They can get it down to the individual house. So it’s a very powerful technique which is now being used all over the country in different studies using sewage to identify people who are shedding the COVID virus.”
Tracking disease in sewage isn’t a new idea. In 1850s London, Dr. John Snow stopped a deadly cholera outbreak by showing people got sick drinking water from a certain well that was contaminated by sewage from a single infected family
Modern disease detectives adapted techniques for COVID-19, but it’s useless without quarantining.
“This tells you who you need to quarantine and where to look for the people to quarantine. Otherwise it’s like a needle in a haystack,” said Blaser.
Cypress Hall students who test positive will be quarantined in separate spaces. Test results are expected by Sept. 21."
234,https://www.tristatehomepage.com/news/coronavirus-watch/two-illinois-counties-under-covid-19-warning-level/,0.0,Two Illinois counties under COVID-19 warning level,"(WEHT) The Illinois Department of Health announced on Friday Wayne and Edwards counties are at COVID-19 warning level. Wabash county remains at warning level.
The Wayne County Health Department says an increase in rates and positivity from Sept. 6-12 led to the warning level. During that period, the county reported 77 news cases; 39 of those were reported on Sept. 12. There was an outbreak of the virus within the Frontier Community College baseball team.
The Edwards County Health Office is now updating COVID-19 every Tuesday. Between Sept. 8 and 15, the county added nine new cases. The week before, they only added three cases.
Wabash county has under under the warning level since Sept. 4.

LATEST CORONAVIRUS NEWS:"
235,https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/bcnews/campus-community/announcements/covid-19-testing-update.html,-0.871,University Health Services reports steady decline in COVID-19 cases,"Boston College has experienced a steady decrease in positive COVID-19 cases on campus this week, following a spike of 73 cases last week (September 7-13) that raised concerns throughout the BC community.
University Health Services (UHS) has conducted 3,465 COVID-19 tests thus far this week, with a total of 15 positive cases. By contrast, the University had 22 positive cases on September 8, and 21 cases on September 9, an increase, UHS officials said, that was attributable to several off-campus gatherings where students did not wear masks or practice physical distancing.
University Health Services expects to have conducted more that 4,000 tests by the end of today. They will report weekly and cumulative totals tomorrow via the Reopening Boston College website bc.edu/reopen.
The University increased its testing capacity this week, in light of last week’s increase in positive cases. Since testing began on August 16, the University has had a total of 122 positive tests, including 120 undergrads. By contrast, Boston University has reported 102 positive cases, Providence College 107, Northeastern University 54, and University of Notre Dame 675.
Currently, there are 85 BC undergraduates in isolation--34 in isolation housing at the Hotel Boston in Brighton, and 51 recovering at home. Thirty-five undergraduates have recovered and returned to normal activities. University administrators say that they have ample space for contact and isolation purposes, and can access beds at Pine Manor College.
“Last week’s spike in cases was concerning to all of us,” said Director of University Health Services Dr. Douglas Comeau. “But the numbers have steadily decreased each day since, and we believe that downward trend will continue as a result of extensive contact tracing efforts.”
Comeau said that Boston College is working closely in its contact tracing with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ Contact Tracing Collaborative (CTC) and the departments of health in Boston, Newton, and Brookline. The Boston Globe had erroneously reported on September 15 that the state was “taking over” BC’s contact tracing efforts, but issued a correction later that day. Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker called University President William P. Leahy, S.J., to clarify that he wanted BC to work collaboratively with the CTC, in light of BC’s connections to the three communities of Boston, Newton and Brookline.
The University continues to conduct contact tracing along with these entities. As of September 14, 74 of the 104 positive cases on campus were identified through the University’s contact tracing efforts.
University Health Services, working with Information Technology Services, said that it would restate weekly undergraduate test totals on the Reopening BC website today to be consistent with The Broad Institute data collection process. The restated undergraduate test numbers do not affect cumulative totals that have been provided or the overall positivity rate.
UHS also announced that it would increase its asymptomatic testing, beginning next week, to Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays throughout the semester, all in the MAC Courts in the Margot Connell Recreation Center, in addition to its daily symptomatic testing conducted through University Health Services and The Broad Institute. The University expects to conduct more than 5,000 tests in the coming week.

Students living in the Darley North Hall, which stands out as one of the tallest buildings in the city of Boulder, received a letter from the school's housing department about the change on Thursday. Students were directed to move out by 5 p.m. on Sunday.
“I just got settled. We have only been here for like three weeks,” said freshman Hunter Burns who is one of the 186 students to move. “Now we have to take all our stuff down and move somewhere else.”
The spokesperson with CU Boulder confirmed that the purpose of this change is to increase isolation space on campus. The spokesperson said students in Darley North Hall will receive additional information from the school's housing department on Friday, which will include a new room assignment.
The school has reported a spike in positive COVID-19 cases on campus and as a result, has increased how much of its isolation spaces it is using.
As of the end of the day Thursday, 67% of the school's isolation spaces were in use, according to CU Boulder's COVID-19 Dashboard, which is available by clicking here. This is part of a growing trend — the percentage was 57% on Wednesday, 46% on Tuesday and 24% on Monday.
University officials said the initial plan was for those isolation spaces to be for single occupancy. If more space is needed, they'll place two people per room. The vacated building will provide more than 300 beds for isolated students.
According to data from the dashboard, 671 on-campus people have tested positive since Aug 24 as of Friday at 8:45 a.m. School officials blame the outbreak on off campus parties.
“Contact tracing has found that most of the likely instances of transmission has been though large gatherings, not maintaining 6 feet and not wearing masks,” said CU Boulder spokesperson Melanie Parra. “The message continues to be that these decisions have impacts on other people.”
According to data from the dashboard, 671 on-campus people have tested positive since Aug 24 as of Friday at 8:45 a.m.
Gov. Jared Polis on Friday was asked if he would consider shutting the college down, if cases continue to grow.
Polis said it was ""critical"" the university contains the spread of coronavirus but that it would not be constructive to send students home.
""That would be very dangerous"" if students returned home from CU, Polis said.
On Tuesday, Boulder County Public Health issued a letter saying it strongly recommends all CU Boulder students self-quarantine for two weeks to contain the outbreak.
The letter to Darley North students reads that Residence Life and Student Housing are working to create additional isolation spaces for campus residents.
""We know that moving mid-semester is challenging, and we are doing everything we can to minimize the impacts of this change for our residents,"" the letter reads. ""We will do our best to keep your community together, though we will not be able to move roommates together due to space availability.""
A $250 credit will be issued to the Darley North students' Bursar's accounts. All students from that hall will need to complete their weekly COVID-19 screening by Friday.
However, freshmen moving from Darley North say this is a difficult time to move.
“They didn’t ask us before, they didn’t give us a warning,” said Darley North resident Connor McGrath. “But what can you do about it now? Not much.”"

(WBAY) - In an effort to catch COVID-19 outbreaks before they happen, a lab at the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh will test wastewater from the residence halls starting next week.
University officials say historically wastewater testing has been a valuable tool for catching the early detection of diseases, which is why the Environmental Research and Innovation Center on campus will soon be collecting and analyzing samples from every residence hall. The lab will process the samples and send them to a private lab for analysis.
“The goal of that is to get early detection for any COVID-positive people that maybe asyptomatic, and catch those positive results quickly so targeting testing can be done,” Greg Kleinheinz, UW-Oshkosh Chair of Sustainable Technology, said.
“Monitoring the dorm wastewater on the U.W.-Oshkosh campus for the presence of COVID-19 will assist university and oshkosh area health officials in public health decision making, as COVID-19 can be shed in the feces of both symptomatic and asymptomatic people,” said ERIC lab manager Carmen Thiel.
At least in the beginning, about 10 samples will be taken twice a week.
Right now, about 2,300 students live on campus.
“It’s proven to work pretty well so far. Arizona State, Idaho, Utah State all used it successfully to stop outbreaks on their campuses,” Kleinheinz said. “U.W.-Madison has also started this with the state lab of hygiene. So we think it’s going to be pretty effective.”
The testing won’t provide any specific numbers when it comes to individual dorms, but it will let the university know if evidence of the virus is high, low, or non-existent.
And it’s not just the university that’s collecting samples from wastewater as a prevention method. The ERIC lab has already been testing sewage at local health care facilities.
“Our group is already doing it for a couple health care providers in the Valley, and it’s for the same reason,"" Kleinheinz said, “so if they have a home with a number of individuals, you can test that wastewater and see if there’s people infected. High schools and other places have lots of people in a confined area, it works really well.”

239,https://www.the-hospitalist.org/hospitalist/article/228779/coronavirus-updates/low-vitamin-d-covid-19-predicts-icu-admission-poor,-2.084,"Low vitamin D in COVID-19 predicts ICU admission, poor survival","Having low serum vitamin D levels was an independent risk factor for having symptomatic COVID-19 with respiratory distress requiring admission to intensive care – as opposed to having mild COVID-19 – and for not surviving, in a new study from Italy.
“Our data give strong observational support to previous suggestions that reduced vitamin D levels may favor the appearance of severe respiratory dysfunction and increase the mortality risk in patients affected with COVID-19,” the researchers report.
Luigi Gennari, MD, PhD, Department of Medicine, Surgery, and Neurosciences, University of Siena, Italy, presented these findings during the virtual American Society of Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) 2020 annual meeting.
Gennari told Medscape Medical News that this analysis suggests determining vitamin D levels (25 hydroxyvitamin D) in people testing positive for SARS-Cov-2 infection might help predict their risk of severe disease.
However, further research is needed to explore whether vitamin D supplements could prevent the risk of respiratory failure in patients with SARS-Cov-2 infection, he stressed.
In the meantime, Gennari said: “I believe that, particularly in the winter season (when the solar ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation exposure does not allow the skin to synthesize vitamin D in most countries), the use of vitamin D supplementation and correction of vitamin D deficiency might be of major relevance for the reduction of the clinical burden of the ongoing and future outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Invited to comment, David Meltzer, MD, PhD, chief of hospital medicine at University of Chicago Medicine, Illinois, who was not involved with the study, agrees.
“I think this body of work suggests that people should be taking supplements if they cannot increase sun exposure on a sustained basis,” Meltzer said. “The abstract supports multiple prior findings that suggest that higher vitamin D levels are associated with improved outcomes.”
And JoAnn E. Manson, MD, DrPH, of Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, who was not involved with the research but has spoken about the topic in a video report for Medscape, said: “We know from several studies that a low vitamin D level is associated with a higher risk of having COVID-19 and severe illness, but correlation does not prove causation.”
“I think that improving vitamin D status is a promising way to reduce the risk of severe illness, but we need randomized controlled trials to prove cause and effect,” she told Medscape Medical News.
103 patients with severe COVID-19, 52 with mild COVID-19, 206 controls
Gennari said several lines of evidence suggest that vitamin D deficiency might be a risk factor for COVID-19 severity.
Countries with lower average levels of vitamin D or lower UVB radiation exposure have higher COVID-19 mortality, and “demographic groups known to be at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency (such as black individuals, the elderly, nursing home residents, and those with obesity and diabetes) are at high risk of COVID-19 hospitalization/mortality, he noted.
There is a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Italy, where mortality rates from COVID-19 have been particularly high.
To examine the relationship between vitamin D levels and COVID-19 severity/mortality, the researchers studied three groups:
103 symptomatic patients with COVID-19 with respiratory insufficiency who were admitted to a Milan hospital from March 9 to April 30.
52 patients with mild COVID-19, recruited from patients and staff from a nearby nursing home who had a positive test for COVID-19.
206 healthy controls, matched 2:1 with symptomatic patients of the same age, weight, and gender, from 3174 patients who had vitamin D measured during a routine check-up from January to March 2020.
Patients in the hospitalized group had lower mean vitamin D levels (18.2 ng/mL) than those with mild COVID-19 (30.3 ng/mL) or those in the control group (25.4 ng/mL).
Patients with symptomatic versus mild COVID-19 were slightly older and more likely to have at least one comorbidity and less likely to be taking a vitamin D supplement at baseline (30% vs 79%).
Among symptomatic patients, mean vitamin D levels were inversely associated with interleukin (IL)-6 and C-reactive protein, “both of which are a direct expression of the inflammatory status,” Gennari noted.
About half of the hospitalized patients (49) were admitted to a ward and discharged after a mean stay of 16 days (none died).
The other 54 hospitalized patients were admitted to the intensive care unit with severe acute respiratory distress; 38 patients received continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and 16 patients received endotracheal intubation.
Of the 54 patients admitted to ICU, 19 patients died from respiratory distress after a mean of 19 days, “consistent with the literature,” and the other 35 patients were discharged after a mean of 21 days.
Patients with severe COVID-19 who were admitted to the ICU, as opposed to a ward, were more likely to be male, have at least one comorbidity, have higher baseline IL-6 levels and neutrophil counts, and lower lymphocyte and platelet counts.
They also had lower mean vitamin D levels (14.4 vs 22.4 ng/mL) and were more likely to have vitamin D deficiency (vitamin D <20 ng/mL; 80% vs. 45%).
Patients admitted to ICU who died had lower baseline vitamin D levels than those who survived (13.2 vs. 19.3 ng/mL).
Vitamin D levels were inversely associated with respiratory distress requiring ICU admission (odds ratio, 1.06; P = .038) and with mortality (OR, 1.18, P = 029), independent of IL-6 levels and other comorbidities.
“That vitamin D levels are associated with improved outcomes independent of IL-6 could reflect that IL-6 is an imperfect measure of the inflammatory process or that vitamin D is related to outcomes for other reasons, such as enhancement of innate or adaptive immunity,” said Meltzer.
He added that “this is not to exclude the possibility that vitamin D has important immunomodulatory effects.”
Gennari, Meltzer, and Manson have reported no relevant financial relationships."

241,https://www.foxnews.com/health/coronavirus-risk-half-school-employees-study,-3.071,"Coronavirus presents risk for about half of school employees, study finds","About half of school employees are at risk for contracting coronavirus, according to a study.
A group of researchers found that up to 51% of all school employees in the United States met criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) for having increased risk or a potential increased risk for contracting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.
“Between 42.0% and 51.4% of all school employees met the CDC definition for being at increased risk of severe COVID-19, depending on whether we used the main or broader CDC definition of increased risk,"" the authors of the preprinted study, which was released ahead of peer review by the journal Health Affairs this week, stated in their report.
The CDC considers high-risk individuals to be those who are in an older age group, and individuals with underlying health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity.
“These results align closely with the 43% of teachers who reported having a physical condition that makes them vulnerable to COVID-19 in a recent nationally-representative Education Week Research Center survey,” the study stated.
PRELIMINARY STUDY INVESTIGATES HOW CORONAVIRUS PARTICLES MAY TRAVEL IN CLASSROOMS, INDOOR AREAS
The researchers also looked at how often individuals at risk for severe novel coronavirus infections were associated with schools, meaning if they worked or lived in the same household with a school employee or school-age children.
“Our results highlight the public health challenge that arises when the risk of school-related exposure is coupled with the potential for within-household transmission,” the study authors wrote in the report.
“We also found that many school employees and many school-age children lived in households with persons with increased risk. Overall, between 63.2% and 71.9% of school employees and between 58.7% and 71.0% of school-age children lived in households with at least one increased-risk adult, depending on the CDC guideline used,” the authors stated in the study.
The team of researchers used data collected between 2014 and 2017 to see how the high-risk individuals for COVID-19 infections were associated with elementary and secondary schools.
“Among all adults with CDC risk factors for severe COVID-19, between 33.9 million and 44.2 million had direct or within-household connections to schools,” the researchers wrote.
The study found that high blood pressure and obesity were the main conditions that put school employees at higher risk of contracting COVID-19. The study also found a difference in risk depending on the type of job the employee had at the school.
“Among school employees, low-skill support staff were more likely to be at increased risk (58.2%), compared to teachers and teacher assistants (37.8%) or administrators and high-skill support staff (39.1%).”
AMID CORONAVIRUS, IS IT SAFE TO SEND CHILDREN BACK TO SCHOOL? EXPERTS, PARENTS WEIGH IN
The study also found that men were more likely to be at increased risk than women, and Blacks more likely than Whites.
“Our analysis finds large numbers of adults who have increased risk of severe COVID-19 and who have a direct or within-household connection to schools,” the study authors said in the report.
They added, “It is important to bear in mind that school reopening represents only one of many possible pathways for exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Individuals face risks of exposure risks in their jobs and communities, even if schools remain closed.”
The study authors noted that the data used in their report predated the novel coronavirus pandemic and doesn’t account for the significant changes in employment, household members, and school attendance that has occurred since the outbreak. They also said there is a possibility the study undercounts the actual number of those meeting the CDC guidelines for the risk of contracting COVID-19 and being connected to a school.

9 a.m. -- A gathering at the Lake of the Ozarks is bringing tens of thousands of motorcycle enthusiasts to Missouri, generating worry that the state’s already fast-growing number of coronavirus cases could spike even higher.
Bikefest Lake of the Ozarks drew about 125,000 people last year. The event, which began Wednesday, bills itself as the largest motorcycle rally in the Midwest. It includes five days of rides, vendor fairs, concerts and stops at area bars and restaurants, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.
Missouri lifted pandemic restrictions on June 16, at a time when the state had a little over 16,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19. In the three months since then, the total has grown to 106,587. As of Wednesday, 1,739 Missourians have died. Missouri has no statewide mask requirement nor capacity limitations, though several local governments have implemented their own restrictions.
The White House Coronavirus Task Force has raised concerns about Missouri. The task force recommended that bars be closed and dining restricted in Missouri counties marked as “yellow” or “red” zones - meaning they have moderate to high levels of virus transmission. Camden and Miller counties, where Bikefest is taking place, are both in red zones, according the task force letter.
Messages left Thursday with Bikefest organizers and a spokeswoman for Republican Gov. Mike Parson were not immediately returned.
Last month, similar concerns were raised before the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, which brought nearly 500,000 motorcyclists to South Dakota. The rally is seen as a big reason why infections have since surged in North Dakota and South Dakota, along with the return to schools and universities.
Missouri ranks near the top of all states for new cases per capita. Hospitalizations are rising, too. Three of the four highest days for hospitalizations have occurred since last week, according to data from the Missouri Hospital Association.
Camden County reported 186 new coronavirus cases -- a 35% increase -- over the past two weeks, according to the University of Missouri’s tracking site. Miller County reported a 49% increase with 123 new cases; and nearby Morgan County saw an 82% increase with 99 new cases.
Steve Edwards, chief executive of Springfield-based CoxHealth, which operates several hospitals and health clinics in southern Missouri, said he is worried that Bikefest will increase cases both locally and wherever participants return home.
“These events tend to draw many people into crowded spaces. It’s especially worrisome if participants gather indoors at bars and restaurants which have proven to be high-risk areas,” Edwards said. “It is reckless.”

It also has tested 117,490 people with 110,507 negative tests for an overall positive test rate of 8.4%. The county said it has tested 195.0 people per 1,000 in the county.
As of Friday morning, the school reopening gating criteria – the 14-day rolling total used by the county to make recommendations on how schools should reopen – slid slightly to 12.1%. The gating criteria also listed 120.4 cases per 100,000 people in the county over the last seven days and the new cases trend is decreasing, per the county.
The county said it is monitoring 15 outbreaks at senior living care facilities. It also said that 94 people from senior living care facilities have died, which is 67.14% of the deaths in Johnson County.
Johnson County health officials lost access to hospital bed utilization in June and have not reported those numbers since June 19.

2:09 p.m. -- The Johnson County Board of Commissioners voted Thursday to reaffirm Gov. Laura Kelly’s executive order requiring masks or other face coverings in indoor spaces in Johnson County, Kansas. The initial mask mandate in Johnson County was passed on July 2 after a lengthy public debate. There was another long debate on Thursday with the board hearing public comments from around 50 Johnson County residents before voting 4-3 to reaffirm the mask. READ MORE
12:30 p.m. -- Clinton High School announced Thursday afternoon that its Friday night game against Pleasant Hill has been canceled due to COVID-19 concerns. The junior varsity game against Pleasant Hill next Monday has also been canceled.
Noon -- Just two weeks after students started returning to Ball State University last month, the surrounding county had become Indiana’s coronavirus epicenter.
Out of nearly 600 students tested for the virus, more than half have been positive. Dozens of infections have been blamed on off-campus parties, prompting university officials to admonish students.
University President Geoffrey Mearns wrote that the cases apparently were tied not to classrooms or dormitories but to “poor personal choices some students are making, primarily off campus.”
""The actions of these students are putting our planned on-campus instruction and activities at risk,” he said.
Similar examples abound in other college towns across the nation. Among the 50 large U.S. counties with the highest percentages of student residents, 20 have consistently reported higher rates of new virus cases than their states have since Sept. 1, according to an Associated Press analysis.
On average, infection rates in those 20 counties have been more than three times higher than their states’ overall rates.
At James Madison University in Virginia, which recently sent students home through September amid a surge in cases, the county is averaging a weekly infection rate of nearly 90 cases per 100,000 people, or more than eight times the statewide average.
Health officials fear that surges among college students will spread to more vulnerable people - older ones and those with underlying health problems - and trigger a new wave of cases and hospitalizations. Some worry that colleges could overwhelm hospitals already bracing for increasing cases of COVID-19 and flu this fall and winter.
“There’s this waiting game. Does it stay on college campuses or will it escape?” said Dr. Jeff Pothof, chief quality officer at the University of Wisconsin medical center in Madison, where cases among college students have been climbing.
While universities have emerged as hot spots in nearly every state, many of the worst outbreaks have been scattered across the South and Midwest. Of the 50 college counties analyzed by the AP, James Madison’s had the highest infection rate, followed by counties that are home to the University of Georgia, Florida State and Indiana University in Bloomington.
In the 10 counties with the highest infection rates, colleges have reported at least 15,000 cases among students and employees in recent weeks, though testing and reporting practices vary significantly and the actual number is probably much higher.
For many colleges, the return to campus was a carefully orchestrated process that took months to plan and millions of dollars to pull off. But as safe as they’ve made their campuses, many colleges have struggled to curb off-campus gatherings that have been tied to thousands of infections.
Parties were blamed for dozens of cases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which brought students back in early August only to send them home weeks later.
Other schools have cracked down on parties and disciplined students. The University of Missouri in Columbia announced this week that it expelled two students and suspended three others for violating rules meant to slow the virus’s spread.
The outbreaks are increasingly straining relations between universities and their towns.
Amid a spike in cases at the University of Colorado at Boulder, county health authorities Tuesday urged all students to quarantine for two weeks. Students and others at the university have accounted for 76% of the county's 663 positive cases over the past two weeks, officials said.
“More stringent and mandatory restrictions will be imposed if students do not comply and break the transmission cycle,” Jeffrey Zayach, executive director of Boulder County Public Health, warned in a letter to students.
In a letter to students, the school's chancellor, Philip DiStefano, warned that the quarantine will be strictly enforced and that students who violate it could face suspension or other discipline. Already, DiStefano said, more than 400 students face university discipline for violating public health orders.
At Miami University in Ohio, county health authorities ordered all of the school's athletes to isolate for 14 days last month after 27 tested positive for the virus. Last week, local police cited six men at an off-campus house party that included several students who had recently tested positive.
As cases increase at Boston College and the campus runs out of quarantine space, the mayor of nearby Newton is asking the school not to use any of the town's hotels or other property to isolate students.
Some cities have tightened rules at bars to discourage students from gathering. As cases surged at Illinois State, the town’s mayor issued an order requiring all bar customers to be seated to be served. He also limited gatherings near campus to no more than 10 people.
Still, residents and officials in many college towns are rooting for universities to work through outbreaks and avoid campus closings that could further hurt the local economy.
Fred Pryce, who manages a series of stores in a strip mall near Ball State, said sending students home would hurt the area’s businesses “big time.”
“That’s 20,000-plus potential patrons that will vanish,” Pryce said. “There are ways to keep students in Muncie safely while they do their classes.”
11:30 a.m. -- Two of Missouri's largest sports arenas will be used as polling places in November, election officials said.
Arrowhead Stadium, home of the Kansas City Chiefs, will be a polling place on Nov. 3. In Columbia, some voters will be able to cast their ballots at Mizzou Arena.
Athletes across the county have led efforts to increase voter registration and promote the importance of voting as part of the response to social justice issues raised since the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis.
Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and safety Tyrann Mathieu have led voter registration drives and the Chiefs organization has posted videos on social media encouraging people to vote.
Missouri athletes have held marches and rallies that included messages urging people to vote. On Wednesday, the basketball team released a video featuring players Mitchell Smith and Dru Smith saying they will push to have the entire team register to vote this year.
Basketball coach Cuonzo Martin said on Twitter it was vital that everyone has a chance to vote.
“We’re thankful to be able to open the doors of our home and commit to making sure the Columbia community has that opportunity,” he said.
11:15 a.m. -- The Kansas City, Missouri, Health Department has reached out to 10 people urging them to self-quarantine after they may have been exposed to COVID-19 at the Chiefs’ home opener last week. The department said an individual who attended the game and watched from a group’s box in Arrowhead Stadium last Thursday tested positive for the coronavirus the very next day. READ MORE
9 a.m. -- Kansas officials are considering spending $50 million to dramatically ramp up testing of people who aren't showing obvious signs of the coronavirus.
A state task force this week backed Kansas Health Secretary Lee Norman’s recommendation to use the federal stimulus money on testing at schools, workplaces and other sites. The goal is to catch coronavirus in people who haven’t even realized they’re carrying it, KCUR reports.
Some of the testing would be done at Wichita State University, where a new not-for-profit lab is gearing up to churn out hundreds of thousands of tests by the end of the year.
“I know that sounds like a lot,” said Tonya Witherspoon, Wichita State’s vice president of industry engagement, “but we think several labs in the state need to be able to do that much - or more.”
Kansas has so far focused most of its energy on people who know either that they are ill or that they have had direct exposure to a confirmed outbreak. But experts say positivity rates should drop when a state or city goes beyond testing these groups of people who are most likely to be sick.
Right now, about 15% of Kansans who get the test find out they have COVID-19. By Johns Hopkins University’s calculations, that puts it among the states with the highest rates of new positives.
On Wednesday, Kansas health officials reported 971 new cases since Monday, for a total of 50,870 across the state. Kansas also had 52 new deaths, raising that number to 586 since the pandemic began.
Norman said at a news conference that 37 of the new deaths were added through a review of death certificates. But that still meant 15 had occurred since Monday, a higher than normal number.
“We are getting to a very sensitive point in time as we talked about during Labor Day with universities, colleges and schools starting back again, athletics those sorts of things,” Norman said. “People are starting to mass gather again in ways that we didn’t see as much of over the summer when people were more dispersed out. As the overall number count goes up, we are going to have more deaths.”
The positive cases include 841 at the University of Kansas, where house parties near campus are raising alarms.
After a debate during the Lawrence City Commission meeting Tuesday, a majority of the commissioners said they were interested in at least considering an ordinance that would make it a municipal offense to violate local health orders designed to stem the spread of the coronavirus, the Lawrence Journal-World reports.
City Attorney Toni Wheeler said the offense would be a misdemeanor that could be prosecuted in municipal court. Violators could face a fine of no more than $500, up to 30 days in jail or both.
However, Vice Mayor Brad Finkeldei and Mayor Jennifer Ananda said they were not sure that creating a municipal ordinance would be the best approach, and that perhaps stronger disciplinary action from the university, such as bans from campus, mandatory quarantines or suspensions, would be more effective.
Meanwhile, Gov. Laura Kelly hosted a discussion with rural hospital administrators on Wednesday where she urged them to “exert pressure” on lawmakers to support a proposal to expand Medicaid in Kansas.
In the discussion, Harold Courtois, CEO for the Memorial Health System in Abilene, said his organization is worried about running out of personal protective equipment, particularly medical N95 respirators, known as N95 masks, ahead of the flu season.
“My fear is that during the influenza season, where everybody appears to have COVID -- whether it’s influenza or not -- PPE is going to become scarce and be very difficult to acquire again,” Courtois said. “It just doesn’t seem like we see a lot of PPE unless you’re willing to pay enormous prices. There’s still price gouging going on every week”
7:30 a.m. -- Johnson County reported Thursday morning 9,740 (+125) cases of COVID-19 since the outbreak started. The county said it has 7,017 presumed recoveries and 140 (+2) people have died since the start of the outbreak.

The county said it is monitoring 14 outbreaks at senior living care facilities. It also said that 94 people from senior living care facilities have died, which is 67.14% of the deaths in Johnson County.
Johnson County health officials lost access to hospital bed utilization in June and have not reported those numbers since June 19.
7:15 a.m. -- Wyandotte County is reporting Thursday morning 6,426 (+26) confirmed cases of COVID-19 since the outbreak started, with 34 patients currently hospitalized and 143 probable cases. The county said 133 (+0) people have died from the coronavirus since the start of the outbreak.
The county updated its dashboard two weeks ago to indicate it will no longer release the number of people recovered.
The dashboard also updated two weeks ago to indicate which ZIP codes have the most recent cases. Over a 14-day period the 66102 ZIP had 68 cases, followed by 66109 with 57 cases and 66104 with 47.
Wyandotte County does not list hospital capacity numbers on its dashboard.
7 a.m. -- The state of Kansas isn’t officially listing the number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, but local health departments across the state are keeping track.

WEDNESDAY5 p.m. -- The number of new coronavirus cases remains high in Missouri, but Gov. Mike Parson on Wednesday cited the state's declining death rate as evidence that progress is being made.
Parson, speaking at a news conference, noted that in the early days of the pandemic in April and May, more than 7% of all cases were fatal. That percentage has gradually dropped and so far this month, just 0.3% of Missourians infected with the COVID-19 virus have died.
“This is all very encouraging and we continue to monitor this data each and every day,” Parson, a Republican, said.
Still, the number of confirmed cases has risen dramatically since the state reopened for business in mid-June. Missouri reported 1,191 new cases on Tuesday, bringing the total to 106,587 since counting began in March. Seven more deaths also were reported. All told, 1,739 Missourians have died from COVID-19.
Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services Director Randall Williams said about 60% of new cases are occurring in areas outside of the state’s metropolitan areas. He said many of the places seeing spikes are mid-sized cities such as Joplin and Cape Girardeau.
“We really need to concentrate on these middle-sized communities,” Williams said.
Parson also cited as reason for optimism what he called “stable” hospitalization totals. But the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that three of the four highest days for hospitalizations have occurred over the past week.
Data shows 1,021 patients in hospitals with confirmed or presumed COVID-19 on Saturday, the second-highest day on record. The highest was Sept. 9, when 1,040 patients were hospitalized. The fourth-highest number of hospitalizations on record occurred Friday, with 1,008 patients.

2:45 p.m. -- The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services reported 1,191 new cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday, bringing the statewide total to 106,587 since the start of the outbreak.
There have now been 1,739 deaths across Missouri from COVID-19, which is up seven from Monday’s total.
Health officials said 989 (-32) patients have been hospitalized due to COVID-19. Due to a change in data measures and the reporting platform issued by the White House on July 13, data on hospitalization reflects a 72-hour delay.

7:20 a.m. -- Leading St. Louis-area doctors are warning residents to brace for at least another year of living with COVID-19.
The region, covering portions of both Missouri and Illinois, has surpassed 1,500 COVID-19 deaths and more than 54,000 confirmed cases since the first positive test in March. St. Louis Public Radio reports that while doctors say they've become better at treating the virus and preventing its spread, life won't likely return to a pre-pandemic “normal” until late 2021 at the earliest, echoing comments made last week by Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
Dr. Alex Garza, who leads the St. Louis Metropolitan Pandemic Task Force, said that despite the persistent number of confirmed cases, the region is in a “better position” now than early on in the pandemic because more is understood about slowing the spread.
Garza noted that the percentage of sick people who die is lower than in early spring. Early in the pandemic, outbreaks were happening in nursing homes, meat plants and other crowded spaces.
Steps such as requiring masks in those places, restricting visitors and increased testing have helped, Garza said.

The school found elevated amounts of Covid-19 in wastewater samples collected from four residence halls on campus.
Officials issued a safety alert on Sunday calling for mandatory testing and quarantine of all 287 students living in Rich, Jones, Morgan and Davis on-campus residence halls.
Classes started Monday at the school and some of the students had just moved into their rooms.
The mandatory quarantine is effective immediately and will continue until the test results are returned. USU also activated a Covid care team to arrange for resources to assist the affected students, including meal deliveries.
Wastewater sampling began July 1 and provides an early alert warning to address potential cases, said Amanda DeRito, a director with the university.
""The benefit of testing the water is that we get a snapshot into what is happening on campus and can quarantine even before a student becomes symptomatic. It is also less invasive,"" DeRito said.
No other testing samples on campus taken this week show elevated levels of the virus and there are currently no reported positive tests for Covid-19 in the quarantined residence halls, according to a university press release.
In mid-August, the CDC announced creation of the National Wastewater Surveillance System to help local public health leaders better understand the extent of the spread of the pandemic in their communities.
Sewage from house and workplaces can be tested for genetic material from the novel coronavirus. Studies show the virus can be found in feces from people who are sick and also from people who don't yet have Covid-19 symptoms.
Testing for all Americans a 'utopian' idea, administration official says
Adm. Brett Giroir, the Trump administration's coronavirus testing czar, on Tuesday dismissed the idea of daily Covid-19 tests for all Americans as ""utopian.""
""It's great to talk about this utopian kind of idea where everybody has a test every day and we can do that,"" Giroir said. ""I don't live in a utopian world. I live in the real world, and the real world had no tests for this new disease when this first started.""
The assistant secretary for health at the US Department of Health and Human Services said that the country now has a ""huge diversity"" of tests, including a $5 point of care test that provides results within 15 minutes.
""There is no stone unturned, there is no technology that we're not looking at or investing in if it's promising,"" Giroir said. ""We can return to society without having everyone have a test every single day. We can do that. We're showing we can do that.
""There may be a time where everybody can wake up in the morning, pass through a tricorder and tell whether they're infected or not,"" Giroir said, referring to the fictional handheld device from ""Star Trek"" that could scan people for data. ""We are not there yet.""
Testing availability and speed has improved in the US, particularly since the disastrous spring delays. Giroir said 91.9% of results from major referral labs, which do about half the tests in the US, were completed in three days. The mean turnaround time in August for large referral labs was 2.27 days.
Still, that 2.27-day average delay allows the virus to quietly spread, and public health and lab industry experts have repeatedly called on the federal government to take a larger leadership role in coordinating testing supplies.
US Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, the House majority whip, responded to Giroir's comments by saying, ""It would not be utopian if we had a national program to combat this pandemic. It may be going state by state. But one national program would not be utopian at all.""
CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen indicated that Giroir was attacking a straw man. Testing is an important part of public health strategy, but no one seriously argues testing can solve everything alone.
""He says, 'People say we can test our way out of the pandemic.' I have never heard anyone seriously say that,"" Cohen said. ""He needs to stop making up these boogie men who he's fighting against. No one is telling him we need a utopia. We're just telling him he needs to do better.""
Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, noted on Twitter that the White House staff has widespread testing, as do sports leagues such as the NFL.
""It's not utopia to want to test teachers & kids to return to school, nursing home residents to stay alive, first responders and other essential workers,"" he wrote. ""Sure, lets call it utopia when it's for the less privileged.""
Dire warnings for Iowa
A White House coronavirus task force report sent to officials in the state of Iowa this week warned of dire new case increases across rural and urban areas and called for a mask mandate, the closure of bars, and for university towns to do more as the pandemic intensifies in the Midwest.
CNN has obtained the nine-page August 30 report for the state, first reported by the Des Moines Register, from the Iowa Department of Public Health. The task force releases state-by-state reports each week to governors' offices, and has so far declined to make them publicly available.
The report says that Iowa is in the task force-defined ""red zone"" and warns that the state has the highest rate of cases in the US, which increased by 77.4% from the previous week.
Campus outbreaks
In the report, the task force points to universities as a major factor contributing to the virus's spread.
The three counties with the highest numbers of cases also have large student populations: Story County, home to Iowa State, and Johnson County, home to University of Iowa, as well as Polk County, which contains Iowa's largest metro area, Des Moines.
The university crossed the 1,000 active case mark on August 29 when it reported 302 cases in a single day. The overall current case load, including employees, is 1,026.
Other schools reported outbreaks.
At the University of South Carolina, 1,017 students currently have Covid-19, according to the university's coronavirus dashboard, making it one of the highest case counts recorded at a college so far.
Despite the climbing active case count and the fact that 60% of the university's designated quarantine space is in use, according to its dashboard, the school still lists its' alert level as ""low.""
The University of Missouri has 424 active student Covid-19 cases, according to the school's Covid-19 dashboard. James Madison University is reporting 138 new Covid-19 positive cases among its students and employees since Monday, according the JMU dashboard.
More than 20,000 cases of Covid-19 among students and staff have been reported at colleges and universities across at least 36 states, according to a CNN tally.
The campus reopenings represent new coronavirus hot spots in a country with plenty enough already as the US surpassed 6 million total confirmed cases on Monday.
NIH rejects plasma treatment
A National Institutes of Health panel said there's no evidence backing the use of convalescent plasma to treat coronavirus patients and that doctors should not treat it as a standard of care until more study has been done.
""There are insufficient data to recommend either for or against the use of convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19,"" the panel of more than three dozen experts said in a statement posted on the NIH website.
The statement, which was posted quietly, contradicts the Trump administration's characterization of the treatment as ""historic"" and a ""major advance"" and directly refers to last week's emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration.
Also Tuesday, an independent committee said any eventual coronavirus vaccine should go first to the people most at risk of catching it.
The draft report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine makes recommendations similar to those that have come from other groups, but it goes into detail to explain why health workers, for instance, should be among the first to get a vaccine."

Many drugs are in the works, and those that succeed could play a role in reducing symptoms and sometimes saving lives. But, given the way drugs are developed, it's unlikely that any single medicine will be anywhere as potent against the coronavirus as a successful vaccine.
So far, scientists have only identified one kind of drug that has been shown to save lives: steroids. A key study found that the steroid dexamethasone reduced death rates among people on ventilators from 41% to 29%. That's a substantial improvement, but still far short of a cure.
The other much-touted drug to treat COVID-19 is remdesivir. The Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization for this drug even though it has not been shown to save lives. It appears to shorten hospital stays.
There's a lot more in the pipeline. Some drugs try to destroy the virus. Others try to control the body's immune system so it doesn't overreact to the infection. Another approach is to prevent the virus from causing an infection.
This week drugmaker Eli Lilly & Co. said it is making progress on its virus-blocking approach. Its experimental product is derived from a person who had successfully fought off infection.
""We found the one antibody in their body that was most potent,"" says Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Lilly's chief scientific officer. ""We engineered it in our laboratories, turned it into a medicine, made it in our factory and started testing in patients"" – all within a remarkably short six-month time span.
This proof-of concept study suggests that the strategy of blocking virus with antibodies holds promise. Inmaculada ""Inma"" Hernandez, at the University of Pittsburgh school of pharmacy, is hopeful, but she doubts that these drugs will be a game-changer.
""These drugs are so complex to produce, probably we will not have antibodies available for treating everybody who gets coronavirus,"" she says. ""They're probably going to be considerably expensive.""
Antibodies as a class are among the highest-priced drugs. And Derek Lowe, a drug developer and author of a blog about the pharmaceutical industry called In the Pipeline, notes that Lilly used hefty doses of these antibodies. The most effective dose appeared to be 2.8 grams — that's heavier than a penny. Making enough to treat the tens of thousands of Americans who get sick every day would require ""truckloads of antibody,"" Lowe said.
Lilly executive Skovronsky says he's hopeful a dose one-fourth of that amount will be effective. And he notes that, unlike other treatments involving antibodies, this one would require just a single dose, which would help extend supplies and reduce the cost per patient.
""We're confident that this will be an affordable drug for society — for governments,"" he says. ""Of course, our expectation would be that governments wouldn't pass any expenses along to patients.""
Lilly is not the only company trying this approach. Regeneron has a cocktail of two potent antibodies that it is now testing. A related approach, called convalescent plasma, involves transfusing blood plasma that contains antibodies. The antibody levels are much less concentrated in the serum than in the experimental drugs.
Blocking infection could be especially important if vaccines now in development prove to be ineffective. Even if there is a mostly effective vaccine, some people are still likely to fall ill. So, to minimize the effects of that, many drug companies are trying to develop drugs that will tamp down the body's overreactive immune system. That leads to potentially deadly inflammation. This is what the steroids do, but the hunt continues for other options.
""The problem is inflammation and the immune system are so just ridiculously complicated, that you have to be empirical,"" says drug researcher Lowe. ""You have to say, 'Well, that looks like a good idea, let's go find out if it's real.' And a lot of the times it's not."" That exploration consumes time and money, and no single drug is likely to do everything that's needed to control the runaway immune system.
Some drugs trying this approach have already failed, such as tocilizumab and sarilumab. Others, including Lilly's baricitinib, are still being tested.
A true ""cure"" for COVID-19 would be a drug, or drugs, that actually knock out the coronavirus itself. There are a few actual cures for viral diseases, including hepatitis C. HIV, which causes AIDS, can also be kept in check for many years with a drug cocktail. But this approach requires a combination of drugs, and finding not just one but multiple drugs that work well together is no easy task. ""If you wanted to do that for the coronavirus, you'd still be looking at quite a few years,"" Lowe says.
Most efforts to find curative drugs for viruses have failed. In fact, the reality in drug development is that most ideas that look great on paper actually fail somewhere along the way. They are either too toxic, or they simply don't work.
Dr. Vinay Prasad, a cancer researcher at University of California San Francisco and frequent critic of the drug-approval process, says even when a medication does work, it is rarely revolutionary.
""Most of our effect sizes are modest benefits,"" he says. ""Five percent benefits. Two percent benefits. One percent benefits.""
When those drugs are combined, the benefits can add up — sometimes to quite effective therapies. But that takes years of trial and error. Prasad uses a baseball analogy for how he thinks coronavirus drug development might play out.
""It's possible that we're going to get singles and doubles,"" he says. ""We might not get the home run, and we might have to rely on the core things that we know control viral spread.""
Masks and social distancing are, in the short run at least, more potent than pills.
Skovronsky at Lilly isn't discouraged, though. He says a cure usually doesn't require any medicine.
""The truth is that for most people who get COVID-19 probably they cure themselves,"" he says. The primary task for drug developers is to find medicines effective for the 5% to 10% of people who get seriously ill.

Through this week’s sample testing of students, the Student Health Services team identified an asymptomatic student, who lives at home with their family, as positive with the virus, according to an announcement sent to students, faculty and staff Friday morning.
The student is isolating at home.
“The university has been prepared for this eventuality, relying on the latest science and health guidelines to establish comprehensive health and safety protocols for testing, identifying and caring for students who test positive for COVID-19,” David Hill, senior medical adviser of the COVID-19 campus task force, wrote in an email to the community.
Since Aug. 5, the university has performed 9,968 on-campus tests, with this being the first positive case. Quinnipiac has published a dashboard on the university website outlining the school’s current risk level, tests performed and confirmed cases.
“This level of detailed planning, expertise and preparation gives us confidence in containing the spread of the virus and maintaining the health of the university community,” Hill said.
The university has implemented a contact tracing protocol to identify locations and individuals with whom the person who tested positive might have had contact. Hill said any person who may have had contact with the positive case will be called directly.
“We appreciate everyone’s continued vigilance with wearing face coverings, maintaining physical distancing, and keeping our gatherings small and responsible,” he said. “Everyone should be checking their symptoms daily using our mobile symptom checking app, and please remember to remain home or in your residence hall, suite or apartment if you’re not feeling well.
“These simple steps will help us continue to protect the ‘Bobcat Bubble’ and maintain a healthy and safe QU community,” Hill said.
Quinnipiac has made use of an app developed in partnership with MyOwnMed called the QU Symptom Checker, in which all members of the school community can perform a daily required self assessment of symptoms.

BLOOMINGTON, Ind. - Indiana University published a report on Thursday detailing a concerning level of positive COVID-19 cases within its Greek housing community, and the school has called for students living in fraternity and sorority houses to “re-evaluate” their current living situations.
“Greek houses at IU Bloomington are seeing this type of spread at quickly increasing rates,” according to a news release by the university.
Due to the nature of living conditions in a Greek house, which typically consists of a high density of residents, shared bathrooms as well as a high concentration of shared living, sleeping and dining spaces, university officials said they are extremely concerned that fraternity and sorority houses are “seeing uncontrolled spread of COVID-19.”
RELATED: UN health agency says no COVID-19 vaccine will be endorsed before it's safe and effective
According to the school, 2,600 students currently live in Greek or various communal housing organizations who attend classes along with 42,000 IU students and 12,000 faculty members, including the surrounding community of Bloomington, Indiana.
School officials now say that coronavirus positivity rates in some of the fraternity and sorority houses are now above 50%.
Of the 42 houses on the school’s roster, 30 were under quarantine as of Sept. 4.
“Greek houses are owned and operated by their respective housing corporations. As such, IU Bloomington does not have authority to operate or manage these privately owned residences,” the university said in a release. “These entities were tasked with developing plans for safe living, quarantine and isolation, but many of those plans are proving to be ineffective in adequately providing for the health and safety of the students living in the houses.”
The news comes as college towns around the country grapple with rising coronavirus cases as many schools move toward renewed shutdowns because of too many parties and too many infections.
The University of Alabama has recorded over 1,000 cases on campus since the fall semester began last week. In closing the town's bars Aug. 31 for the next two weeks, Tuscaloosa Mayor Walt Maddox said that an unchecked spread of the virus threatens both the health care system and the local economy if students have to be sent home for the semester for remote learning.
With more than 300 students at the University of Missouri testing positive for the coronavirus and an alarming 44% positivity rate for the surrounding county, the local health director on Aug. 28 ordered bars to stop serving alcohol at 9 p.m. and close by 10 p.m.
Iowa’s governor has ordered all bars shut down around the University of Iowa and Iowa State, while the mayor of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, did the same in the hometown of the state’s flagship university.
“What we’re seeing in our violations is they’re coming late at night,” said Stephanie Browning, head of the health department for Columbia, Missouri. “Big groups gathering. They’re not wearing their masks, they’re not social distancing.”
In Utah, the city council in Provo overrode a mayoral veto to pass a mask mandate, which includes a $500 fine for organizing large mask-less gatherings, days before students return to Brigham Young University from around the country.
The outbreaks since students began returning to campus in the past few weeks have heightened tensions between colleges and their towns and led to recriminations between local politicians and university officials.
Meanwhile, California announced a four-tiered, color-coded plan late last month for gradually reopening businesses after abandoning a reopening attempt earlier this summer. It requires counties to meet certain benchmarks showing progress in controlling the virus.
Three of North Carolina’s largest public universities have abruptly halted in-person undergraduate instruction and directed students to move out of the dorms after hundreds tested positive following their return to campus. More than 800 have been infected at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and over 670 at North Carolina State.
Leaders at UNC-Chapel Hill, which has shifted to online classes, wrote an open letter Thursday to the mayor outlining steps the university is taking to curb off-campus parties.
“We recognize the very real problems with the behaviors of some of our fraternities and sororities,” the letter said.

(AP) — A school counselor at a central Kentucky Army post that started in-person classes in August has died after being diagnosed with the coronavirus, officials said.
Fort Knox Middle-High School counselor Pamela Harris was diagnosed with the virus and was being treated at a local hospital when she died Tuesday, said Will Griffin, spokesman for the Department of Defense Education Activity.
The school said on social media that the Army veteran had served as a Defense Department educator in the southeast district for several years.
“Her kindness, energy, and love for her job, was seen daily as she greeted students, and co-workers, with a smile and an encouraging word. The joy she possessed in her heart spilled over on to everyone in the building and in the surrounding community,” the post said.
The Federal Education Association-Stateside Region, which represents educators and support professionals at schools on military bases, said in a statement that it had repeatedly warned management about the dangers of opening schools for in-person learning and advocated for online lessons.
Fort Knox switched to remote learning in early September, but only after Ms. Harris and several other school employees reported COVID symptoms, the statement said.
“Ms. Harris’ death was completely avoidable, had DoDEA exercised proper precautions,” the education association said in a statement.
The school is scheduled to resume in-person classes on Sept. 21, the association said.
Griffin said the Department of Defense Education Activity continues its efforts to safely return to learning in an environment that best supports student achievement.
“DoDEA school operations impact the readiness of our military to complete their mission. And we must continue to meet our mission and support readiness by providing military-connected students with a quality education,” he said.
“The health and safety of our students and employees is always our primary focus. We will continue to partner with our installation commands, parents and students to provide our children with quality education in the safest and most effective manner possible.""
Diane Gibbs, with the Federal Education Association, said the safest way to educate in the pandemic is online.
“To prevent any other deaths of staff members or students, DoDEA Director Tom Brady should immediately implement remote operation at all DoDEA schools,"" Gibbs said in the statement. “Cases have been springing up elsewhere throughout DoDEA.

One of the marquee matchups, scheduled less than a week ago, for Week 3 has been postponed.
No. 24 Baylor and Houston were set for a Saturday afternoon tilt in Waco until the Bears announced Friday they did not reach the Big 12's COVID-19 game cancellation thresholds. It's the third time Houston has seen its opener disappear and the third instance for Baylor.
The two programs saw their original matchups for last weekend called off; Baylor's against Louisiana Tech had to be canned due to Hurricane Laura, and Houston's due to a coronavirus outbreak at Memphis. The sides quickly came together to schedule a new opener.
""The loss of this game is a devastating blow, but in the interest of the health and safety of our student-athletes, we believe we made the necessary decision,"" Baylor athletic director Mack Rhoades said in a statement. ""We are incredibly disappointed with the continued delay to the start of our season, and empathize with our student-athletes, fans, coaches, and administrative staff.""
The thresholds, announced earlier this month, specify that the minimum number of players required for a game is 53, with additional minimums of available offensive linemen (seven), interior defensive lineman (four) and quarterback (one).
The postponement is the third game in the last two days to be called off due to coronavirus positive tests or contact tracing. Charlotte and No. 11 North Carolina could not play after the 49ers lost their offensive line due to contact tracing, and Florida Atlantic's game against Georgia Southern was postponed earlier Friday.
Rhoades said the two programs will keep their home-and-home agreement in place at future dates. At this point, Baylor and Houston playing in 2020 appears unlikely. The Bears currently have open dates on Oct. 10 and Nov. 21, while the Cougars are free on Oct. 3."

Experts said Joe Biden’s claim that a different pandemic response from President Donald Trump would have prevented every coronavirus death goes too far.
A more robust handling of the pandemic would likely have seen the country’s death count significantly reduced, but not to zero, experts said.
Even countries that have found relative success managing the coronavirus — such as South Korea and New Zealand — have seen some deaths.
Speaking about the coronavirus during a CNN town hall less than two months away from Election Day, former Vice President Joe Biden said every one of the nearly 200,000 COVID-19 deaths recorded in the U.S. can be laid at President Donald Trump’s feet.
""If the president had done his job, had done his job from the beginning, all the people would still be alive,"" Biden said at the CNN town hall in Moosic, Pa. ""All the people. I'm not making this up. Just look at the data. Look at the data.""
The Democratic presidential nominee’s remark came as Trump faces criticism for downplaying the threat of the coronavirus early on and admitting on tape that he did so. The U.S. leads the world in confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths, and experts say a fall surge in cases could put fatalities at more than double their current number by the year’s end.
A more robust handling of the pandemic would likely have seen the country’s death count significantly reduced, experts said. But Biden’s claim that a different response from Trump would have prevented every coronavirus death goes too far.
""I think it’s impossible to say every life could have been saved,"" said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security.
Keeping COVID-19 at zero deaths would have been a difficult achievement ""regardless of who is in charge,"" said Brooke Nichols, an assistant professor of global health at Boston University.
""If we had developed testing capacity as soon as we knew of the pathogen, and could rapidly test every one arriving from abroad, then I suppose it’s theoretically possible, but unlikely,"" Nichols said.
Even countries that have found relative success managing the coronavirus — such as South Korea and New Zealand — have seen some deaths.
Experts said that faster, more robust measures taken by the federal government could have put the U.S. on par with those countries and others that responded similarly.
The right actions in January, February and March would likely have prevented ""a substantial number"" of deaths, Adalja said, and could have put the U.S. on ""a trajectory more like Taiwan,"" which has recorded just 503 confirmed cases and seven deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.
Those actions might have included a national coordinated strategy across state lines, rapidly scaled up testing, the ramped up production and mobilization of resources, and more clear communications of what was known about the virus and how to prevent it, experts said.
""Obviously, you could logically say that if you had a process that was ongoing and you started mitigation earlier, you could have saved lives,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, told CNN in April. ""Obviously, no one is going to deny that.""
Featured Fact-check
“Putting a national lockdown, stay-at-home orders, is like house arrest. Other than slavery, which was a different kind of restraint, this is the greatest intrusion on civil liberties in American history.""
One May study from Columbia University estimated that the U.S. could have averted roughly 36,000 COVID-19 deaths before May if sweeping mitigation measures imposed on March 15 had instead gone into effect a week earlier.
Almost 54,000 deaths would have been avoided in that timeframe had the same interventions started two weeks earlier, the study said.
""Had we mustered the political and public will to act as we did two weeks earlier, 90% of deaths through the beginning of May would have been averted,"" said study author Jeffrey Shaman, a professor of environmental health sciences.
But the study ""doesn’t blame Trump,"" Shaman said, although he added that ""the country has witnessed a complete lack of federal leadership.""
Other experts have also made estimates. A pair of epidemiologists wrote in an April op-ed for the New York Times that ""an estimated 90% of deaths"" from the first wave of U.S. cases ""might have been prevented by putting social distancing policies into effect two weeks earlier.""
Op-ed co-author Nicholas Jewell, a professor of biostatistics at the University of California, Berkeley, said it would be ""magical thinking"" to suggest 100% of COVID-19 deaths could have been prevented. ""I haven’t seen any country really succeed to that extent,"" Jewell said.
In a June op-ed for Stat, researchers compared the U.S. response to similar nations. Accounting for differences in population and the different timings of the outbreaks in each country, they concluded that the U.S. could have prevented many deaths.
If, for example, the U.S. ""had acted as effectively as Germany, 70% of U.S. coronavirus deaths might have been prevented"" in the four months after the U.S. recorded its first 15 cases of the coronavirus, the researchers wrote. More lives would have been saved had the U.S. mirrored the responses of other countries such as South Korea, they said.
The picture hasn’t been much rosier of late. ""If you look at May and June 1, since then, we’ve done dreadfully in the U.S.,"" Jewell said.
Still, Biden’s claim that ""all the people would still be alive"" had Trump responded differently is an overstatement. ""I don’t see how there is any truth to that,"" Nichols said.
The Biden campaign did not respond to requests for comment.
Our ruling
Biden said, ""If the president had done his job, had done his job from the beginning, all the people would still be alive. All the people. I'm not making this up. Just look at the data.""
Experts disagreed with that assessment. A stronger U.S. response could have saved many lives, experts said, but not every one.
We rate this statement False."

The school conducted 400 COVID-19 tests from Sept. 7-14 on student-athletes and staff members resulting in a total of 46 positive tests. Of those tests, 376 were administered to student-athletes and 45 came back positive. Twenty-four staff members were tested, with one positive test.
The results come the same week the Ingham County Health Department recommended all Michigan State University students self-quarantine to contain a coronavirus outbreak from which at least 342 people have tested positive for the disease since Aug. 24. It also mandated that 30 large houses quarantine for 14 days, include 23 fraternity or sorority houses and seven rental houses.
On Thursday, 11 more large houses in East Lansing with known exposure to COVID-19 were ordered to quarantine for the next two weeks. That brought the total to 39 large houses under mandatory quarantine after two were previously removed from the list following further investigation.
Student-athletes that test positive will have daily check-ins with athletic training staff while the individuals remain in isolation, with additional services provided as directed by the medical and administrative staffs. Further testing and physician follow-up will be required prior to returning to any level of workouts.
Since the beginning of June, Michigan State has conducted more than 1,950 COVID-19 tests on student-athletes and staff members. There have been more than 1,610 tests on student-athletes, with 93 positive results. Since June 15, there have been more than 333 tests on staff members, at locations both on and off campus, with six positive results."

The school has issued a safety alert with local health departments to quarantine and test all 287 students that reside in the suspected residence halls. Those on-campus dormitories include Rich, Jones, Morgan, and Davis. There are no reported positive cases from the students who live at those residence halls as of right now, according to the USU press release.
The university said they test wastewater as a precautionary measure to help prevent an on-campus outbreak. All 287 students are asked to quarantine until they receive the results of their tests. The school said it could take up to four days to get all the results back.
These students must stay in their room or suite, not attend class or interact with those outside their household unless absolutely necessary (such as for COVID-19 testing)
The school said they have an emergency ""COVID CARE"" team that will go each student's rooms to ensure each student is aware that they will be tested, asked to isolated in the meantime and to make sure they have sufficient food supplies. Teachers and other school faculty members will work to make accommodations for students affected by this safety alert.

The local health department expected an increase in cases of the respiratory disease when school resumed, but not at the levels the county is experiencing, she said, adding the county is seeing instances of University of Wisconsin-River Falls students bringing the disease home to parents and younger siblings.
Snyder said she is in frequent contact with university administrators as they consider response options.
The UWRF online COVID-19 dashboard reported 51 positive cases out of 865 on-campus tests conducted Aug. 26-Sept. 16.
An outbreak was identified in connection to a Walnut Street yard party in River Falls held Saturday, Sept. 5, the university announced on Facebook. Anyone who attended the gathering is asked to get tested for COVID-19, even if not experiencing symptoms. UWRF testing information can be found at go.uwrf.edu/gettested.
“We’re going to need more than the usual that Pierce County is used to during the pandemic to turn this one around,” Snyder said, such as cancelling activities that involve congregations of young people.

Disease activity in Pierce County was at the “Red” level as of Friday based on metrics in Harvard University’s Path to Zero framework for suppressing the spread of COVID-19. That is the highest risk level, with greater than 25 new cases a day per 100,000 population.
“If serious measures aren’t taken to curb the spread of disease, it’s possible that the health care systems will become overwhelmed in a short time period,” Snyder said.
There were 54 active cases of COVID-19 in Pierce County and 84 current probable cases Friday, according to the county’s pandemic dashboard. Six residents have died due to the disease.
Pierce County Public Health announced this week two instances of a patron who visited a River Falls bar and later tested positive for COVID-19. The potential exposures occurred sometime between midnight and 2 a.m. early Saturday, Sept. 12, at Maverick's Corner Saloon and Broz Sports Bar & Grill.
Wisconsin set a new record Friday with 2,553 new cases added in a single day, according to the Department of Health Services. That broke Thursday’s one-day record of 2,034 new confirmed cases.

The new cases added to the UA System's online COVID-19 Dashboard were identified from Sept. 11 - 17 and represent the lowest number of new cases identified over a one-week testing period since classes began. Additionally, 17 new cases were identified among faculty and staff on the Tuscaloosa campus during this time.
With Friday's update, the total number of cases for the three-school system is up to 2,729 since classes began in late August. The Tuscaloosa campus represents the largest portion of those cases, with 2,461 cumulative cases.
The UA System said in its accompanying press release that Friday's report signals a continued decline in positive cases and a dramatic reduction in the occupancy rate of isolation/quarantine space across the system.
The occupancy rate of quarantine space on UA's Tuscaloosa campus was at 3.88% and 6.15% systemwide.
Sentinel testing of students, faculty and staff is also ongoing, the system said, with less than 1% of those in the sentinel program testing positive
Dr. Ricky Friend, who serves as dean of the College of Community Health Sciences (CCHS) and member of the UA System Health and Safety Task Force, said he was pleased to report that UA's number of daily cases, active cases and use of isolation and quarantine space have all dramatically declined.
""This is encouraging and reiterates that, when the health and safety precautions are followed, they work very well to contain and minimize cases across the UA campus and throughout the UA System,"" he said.

(WJZ) — The University of Maryland is asking a group of students in Denton Hall to “restrict activities: after a surge of coronavirus cases were reported there.
“Following a recent rise in COVID-19 positive cases in Denton Hall, the University of Maryland has initiated several precautionary measures to help stop the spread of the virus,” the university said in a statement. “All students who tested positive are in isolation and anyone who was in close contact with these students was notified and moved to designated quarantine housing.”
Out of an abundance of caution, the university is asking students in Denton Hall to restrict their activities and practice enhanced social distancing.
“Students are provided a case manager and will have access to a variety of resources, including meal delivery,” the statement continued.
Twenty three students tested positive over a two-week period in Denton Hall. Nine others who were in direct contact with these students are in quarantine.
“The health and safety measures we implemented this fall — mandatory testing, daily symptom monitoring, 4 Maryland behaviors — have allowed us to track and monitor positive cases within our community,” the university stated. “It is our hope and expectation that these temporary measures will allow in-person activities for these residents to resume on October 2.”
The union that represents the more than 3,400 employees at the University of Maryland College Park said its workers are concerned for their own safety following what they report is an increase in coronavirus cases on campus.
AFSCME Local 1077 said 200 students who in the Denton dorm have been put under a quarantine/stay in place order for 14 days.
“As employees of UMCP and as members of the campus community, Local 1072 is once again disappointed by results of the administration’s go-it-alone stance,” said Union President Todd Holden. “The news of this outbreak is just another in a growing list of unilaterally-imposed “solutions” that have fallen short without properly respecting the voices of front line workers, all of whom knew how this would likely play out since the pandemic’s start. Now, hundreds of students are at risk. Our members who service these students – and members’ families – are now at risk, too, and AFSCME will work to make sure they are informed, equipped, and protected from what comes next.”
According to the university’s COVID-19 dashboard, there have been 88 new coronavirus cases reported the week of Sept. 6-12. Another 82 unverified COVID-19 cases were self-reported to the university by students.
The Diamondback, a student-run newspaper on campus, reported an outbreak of cases among athletes earlier this week."

In the past two weeks, there have been 23 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, in Denton Hall, which houses 247 students. Officials have already isolated those who tested positive and placed those in direct contact in official quarantine housing on campus, according to Hafsa Siddiqi, a university spokesperson.
The university is not calling the measure for the remaining dorm residents a quarantine, rather “enhanced health precautions.” But the result is similar, as they have been asked to stay put, in their rooms as much as possible, wearing a mask to the bathroom. They were told not to go to class or to cafeterias; they will be given meal delivery.
“At the direction of University Health Center staff, in close consultation with the Prince George’s County Health Department, we are implementing enhanced health precautions within Denton Hall,” the message reads. “All residents of Denton Hall must restrict activities, practice enhanced physical distancing, and self-monitor for the next 14 days.”
The notice went into effect at 5 p.m. Friday and lasts through noon on Oct. 2. The students were asked to go to a campus testing site next week.
The university said in a statement that it had implemented safety measures for returning students and staff, with mandatory testing and symptom monitoring.
There have been other cases on campus since students began returning in late August. The latest restrictions were not reflected on the campus' online dashboard, where the school is reporting the number of cases and quarantines.
The campus dashboard has reported 252 positive cases among the tests that it has administered to students and staff and, as of Thursday, 152 people in quarantine. Another 193 cases have been self-reported among students and staff.
College Park is among those in higher education that chose to return students to campus, though Prince George’s County, where the campus is located, has been the state most affected jurisdictions by the virus, with more than 28,000 cases. The state has logged more than 119,000.
Many colleges in the state and around the country such as Johns Hopkins, Morgan State and Loyola University Maryland are holding classes online only. Some campuses around the country and locally have already canceled in-person classes after outbreaks, including Towson University.
The latest actions at College Park drew concern from staff working on campus, who have been raising safety issues for weeks. A union representing the workers said it was informed of the restrictions Friday afternoon among students in Denton Hall.
AFSCME local 1072 represents about 3,400 workers from house keepers to accountants on campus. Members have been pressing campus leaders to provide more protections for students and workers. The workers were fearful of infection because many can’t keep their distance as they perform their jobs, said Stuart Katzenberg, a union spokesman.
Todd Holden, union president, said members were not being given enough protective gear. And now he says, they aren’t being given much information, saying campus leadership had a “go-it-alone” stance."

It can be if you follow these guidelines,"Over 5 million Michiganders are expected to vote in the upcoming November third election. And while state election officials are predicting that a record number of ballots will be cast before election day, there are still plenty of people who prefer to vote in-person.
(WXYZ) — Over 5 million Michiganders are expected to vote in the upcoming November third election. And while state election officials are predicting that a record number of ballots will be cast before election day, there are still plenty of people who prefer to vote in-person.
But with the on-going pandemic, many are wondering, ‘Is in-person voting safe from COVID-19’?
There are many folks, including some of my patients, who are wondering just how safe in-person voting is. And the answer is that it can be safe. But, and this is very important, you have to be very careful and you should follow guidelines.
Even then, there is no guarantee that it will be 100% safe.
Michigan’s Secretary of State has talked about some of this. Like how election workers will be wearing masks, gloves, and face shields. And how voters can expect public areas to be sanitized and social distancing protocols to be in place. And all of that is very helpful.
But you’ll want to know more details than that. For instance:
will voters be waiting in lines outside?
how many people will be allowed inside at a time?
will there be plexiglass between voters and poll workers?
and also, is there an entrance door and a different exit door, allowing for one-way traffic?
Now, it’s also important to know the location of your precinct. If you can, it’s best to avoid high-risk facilities like senior care places. The safer locations, in general, are places like community recreation centers, convention centers, school gymnasiums, and large parking lots.
You really don’t want to be stuck in a long line inside an enclosed narrow hallway. The virus especially loves indoor spaces with poor ventilation. So here’s my advice:
Try to avoid busy voting times like lunchtime and before or after work hours. Mid-morning and mid-afternoon tend to be less busy.
Next, be sure to wear a face mask. The best masks are made of cotton and they have two or three layers of fabric.
Also, please keep your mask over your nose. The virus is more likely to enter through your nose because that’s how the majority of us breathe.
And lastly, I suggest bringing your own pen, some hand sanitizer, or disinfecting wipes. That way once you’ve used the voting booth, you can clean your hands immediately.

The 45 positive results were returned after samples were taken Sept. 7-14, the university said Friday.
Meanwhile, there was only one case among the 24 staff members checked for the novel coronavirus during the same period.

Last Saturday, Ingham County health officials urged Michigan State students to quarantine after an outbreak in East Lansing. Mandatory lockdowns were also issued for large properties in the area.
The orders came shortly before the Big Ten announced Wednesday that football would return with stringent protocols.

Under the new guidelines, teams would have to stop practice for at least a week if the positivity rate based on a seven-day rolling average exceeded 5% among players and 7.5% within the entire program. The last number will be determined by dividing the number of positive individuals by the total population at risk.
“I do think that it's going to be very, very critical that our student-athletes, our coaches, everybody that might be around our team is following all the rules; wearing their masks, being distant from each other when possible, washing their hands regularly, all the sort of basic things, staying away from parties and large gatherings,” Michigan State athletic director Bill Beekman said this week. “And frankly, even small gatherings. Some of our student-athletes that have tested positive recently weren't at events that were 100 people at a bar, it was three or four friends getting together in an apartment to play cards. But even those seemingly innocent things can pass the virus.
“And I think, frankly, that's a message for everybody in our community. We need to be responsible. And if we're responsible, then we'll be able to field a team and play the games. And if we're not, we won't and we'll have to deal with the consequences of that.”
Michigan State's football team has already been scarred by COVID-19, having endured a two-week quarantine that began in July.
Since early June, the university has administered more than 1,950 COVID-19 tests on student-athletes and athletic department staff members. Ninety-nine positive results have been returned.
""We trust our medical folks, and we're going to follow our protocols to the best of our ability,"" Spartans football coach Mel Tucker said.

But after 18 of the 19 Orange County teams tested were cleared to play on Thursday the games took center stage.
Apopka, the No. 1 ranked team in the Sentinel Super 16 preseason rankings, found itself in a dogfight against underdog Ocoee. The Blue Darters survived, eking out a 15-13 win at home.
Ocoee, which is 0-14 all-time against Apopka, jumped out to a surprising 13-0 advantage. The Knights scored first on a fourth-and-2 play and increased their lead with double-pass trick play.
Apopka answered with two TDs and then scored on a safety to take a 15-13 lead heading into the fourth quarter.
Area No. 2 Edgewater, playing on the road against national No. 1 IMG Academy of Bradenton, played the Ascenders to a 0-0 tie through one quarter but couldn’t maintain that momentum against a boarding school team loaded with major college prospects. IMG dominated the second half and scored a defensive touchdown on the game’s final play to win 48-7.
Edgewater, the 2019 Class 7A state runner-up, marched 76 yards for its score in the second quarter. Quarterback Canaan Mobley scored from one yard out. But the Eagles managed just 43 offensive yards in the second half.
The game of the night may have been Lake Mary’s 15-14 comeback win against rival Lake Brantley. The Rams, ranked No. 13, rallied with two fourth quarter touchdowns and then played for the win. They succeeded on a two-point conversion try to prevail against the No. 14 Patriots.
Lake Mary quarterback Gunnar Smith passed to Sterle Scott for the game-winning TD and then again for the crucial conversion. Earlier, Marquis Jones took a screen pass from Smith and took it 50 yards for a TD.
Host Boone, the No. 15 team in the Sentinel Super 16, threw a scare into sixth-ranked Dr. Phillips before losing 48-41 in a wild one. The Braves used big plays to jump out to 6-0, 13-6 and 20-13 leads in the first half.
An interception by Zion Trimboli led to a short DP touchdown by Jaydan Taylor to give the Panthers their first lead of the night, 27-20, in the third quarter. Amir Johnson then set up a DP touchdown with a 65-yard scamper and then scored a TD on a 5-yard run. DP’s lead was 48-20 with 10 minutes to go in the fourth quarter.
Boone opened the scoring after Diego Rivera blocked a DP punt. Shambre Jackson, a 6-4, 235-pound four-star prospect scooped up the ball and returned it 43 yards for a touchdown.
Boone added an 80-yard pass play from quarterback Casey St. John to his brother, Parker, and a 70-yard run by Jackevis Lovett for touchdowns.
No. 3 Jones opened up a 32-6 third quarter lead and hung on to win 32-26 against No. 12 Bishop Moore. Daquan Harris ran for three touchdowns in the early going for the Tigers. Jonathan Aleem Jr. forced a fumble took it 55 yards for a defensive score for Jones.
No 9 Wekiva turned on the running clock in a 46-7 win against East River at home. The Mustangs scored on five of their first six offensive possessions. Senior QB Junior Muratovic passed for three TDs in the victory.
Lake Nona rolled to a 42-0 win vs. Cypress Creek. Colin Campbell opened the scoring with a 45-yard TD run for the Lions. Zane Durant upped the lead to 14-0 with a 25-yard fumble recovery return and another TD by Campbell on a pass from Cody Morell made it 21-0 in the first quarter. Aidan Platon added two TD runs and Jarion McClain completed the scoring with a 40-yard punt return TD.
Two new head coaches debuted with victories. Oviedo won 28-6 over Colonial to welcome aboard coach Kolby Tackett. And Oak Ridge took advantage of eight Freedom turnovers to win 35-6 in the first outing as a head football coach for Billy Owens, a longtime basketball coach.
Coaches of Orange County Public School teams had an agonizing week with the school district checking athletes and coaches for the virus. But only Evans was not cleared to play due to positive tests.
The Trojans on Wednesday were flagged for five positive tests within its program. OCPS ordered the entire team, including players, coaches and trainers, to quarantine away from school. It canceled Thursday night’s scheduled season-opening Evans vs. West Orange game.
In a memo sent to parents late Thursday afternoon OCPS said 1,403 tests were administered with only five confirmed positive cases of COVID-19. That is a .0035% positivity rate. The district said testing was an effort to protect all of its high school students.
Olympia was the one team not tested, because its campus has been closed to students for two weeks. The Titans opener vs. Windermere High was scrubbed after the district determined that more than 150 students and staffers at the school were exposed to COVID-19. Olympia students are set to return to school Monday and the Titans are scheduled to play at home next Friday night against Gateway.
OCPS also canceled a Thursday night girls JV girls volleyball match due to a positive COVID test. At least some members of the Boone JV squad were quarantined, according to a school district announcement.
A handful of Orlando area private schools played games over the past two weeks but Thursday marked opening night for public school teams in Orange, Seminole and Volusia County.
The Orange County school district is not charging admission for games but limited tickets to two per player and one for faculty and staff members. Cheerleaders, bands and other groups that traditionally have performed at football games were not allowed to as a cautionary measure.
Most other schools also limited attendance and asked fans to wear masks and abide by social distancing guidelines. Compliance with those requests were mixed — just as they were in Weeks 1 and 2.
A marquee matchup pitting No. 4 Seminole at No. 5 DeLand was also canceled due to a coronavirus case. A DeLand assistant coach contracted the virus and the school decided to send close to 20 players and all of its football coaches home for a two week quarantine that ended Tuesday.

The Ankeny Community School District released proposed guidelines Friday on when the district would move students online during the COVID-19 outbreak.
The proposed ""Return To Learn"" matrix comes ahead of a school board vote Monday and details two instances that would bring the district to switch to remote learning.
Under the guidelines, the district would move a school or schools to online learning with a building absence rate of more than 10% alongside a Polk County positivity rate of more than 5%.
The district would also move online in the event of an absence rate of more than 5% and a positivity rate of more than 10%.
The district’s proposed matrix is lower than the state's guidelines, which require a 15% county positivity rate with 10% absenteeism or a county positivity of 20%.
The proposal mentions seeking state approval before implementing remote learning.
The Ankeny Community School District declined to comment on the proposed matrix Friday but told a district spokesperson told KCCI Thursday that the district would abide by whatever decision the Iowa Department of Education made.
The Department of Education said it previously granted online learning waivers to districts below its 10% absenteeism threshold.
The proposal also mentions thresholds for staying with hybrid learning or moving to on-site learning."

On Tuesday, University of Utah Health began offering saliva testing at its Sugar House, Redwood, South Jordan and Farmington clinics.
Likewise, Intermountain Healthcare is working on its saliva tests and lab processes in order to make the tests available in two to three weeks, spokesman Jess Gomez said Friday.
“We made this switch because saliva testing is so much more comfortable than the traditional method. . . . With saliva testing, all we have to do is spit into a small tube, fill the tube up just a little bit, and that gives us the sample that we need,” said Dr. Richard Orlandi, U. Health chief medical officer of ambulatory health.
“We can get a very accurate test, as accurate as the traditional back of the nose test ... and we can do it just as fast with the same turnaround time, usually about 24 to 48 hours,” he said.
U. researchers said in late August that saliva samples are easier to collect and appear to be safer for test administrators as those getting tested are less likely to produce the aerosols that transmit the coronavirus as compared to the nasal swab test. Saliva testing also enables the use of less personal protective equipment, researchers said.
The health care system will still offer nasal swabs in rare cases; for example, when a patient has dry mouth or another condition that makes nasal testing necessary, Orlandi said.
The change comes as Utah has continued to perform a lower number of tests each day than it did during the state’s surge in June and July. While testing capacity remains at 7,000 a day, an average between 2,000 and 5,000 people each day have actually gotten tested for the past several weeks.
State officials continue to urge anyone with one or more symptoms including fever, cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, sore throat, or a loss in sense of taste or smell to get tested. Those who are asymptomatic but had close contact with a confirmed case are also encouraged to get tested.
New cases rising above the 400 benchmark
Utah continued to see an uptick in new COVID-19 cases on Friday as another 513 were confirmed, as well as five additional deaths.
The new cases were reported out of 6,057 tests, with an 8.5% positive rate, according to the Utah Department of Health.
Since the pandemic began, Utah has confirmed 53,839 cases of 679,716 people tested.
The rolling seven-day average for new cases again surpassed 400 on Friday. The average is now 411 cases per day, and the average positive test rate is 9.4%.
In the last two weeks, much of the state has continued to see either a moderately high rate or high rate of new COVID-19 cases, according to state health department data. The only areas seeing a low rate include San Juan County — which once had among the highest rates of disease in the state — as well as Duchesne, Grand and Emery counties.
Many rural towns in southern and central Utah, including Blanding, Monticello, Richfield, Monroe, Salina, Delta and Fillmore, are also seeing low rates of the disease, as well as much of southwest Utah excluding Washington and Iron counties.
Gov. Gary Herbert had challenged Utah to reach a rolling average below 400 by Sept. 1, which the state accomplished, but officials have said they expected another rise in new cases as the school year began.
“We are mindful of COVID-19 cases appearing in various areas of the state, including in our schools. This is expected with many returning to the classroom. Our health departments are committed to providing the best health guidance so schools can effectively reduce outbreaks,” Herbert tweeted on Thursday.
Utah now has confirmed 38 school outbreaks resulting in 169 cases and eight hospitalizations, according to state health department data. To be considered an outbreak, the cases must result from transmission in a single location by a known contact at a known time, state health officials note. Data on school outbreaks doesn’t account for all cases associated with schools throughout the state.
At least three schools in Utah, including Pleasant Grove High School and two charter schools — the Utah Military Academy and American Preparatory Academy’s Draper location — have halted classroom teaching or altered scheduling due to campus COVID-19 outbreaks.
Brigham Young University officials said Friday the campus has at least 40 cases of COVID-19, many of which “have been tied to gatherings both on-campus and off-campus.” University administrators are asking those who may have been exposed to the disease at gatherings to quarantine.
While there isn’t a statewide database for schools with outbreaks or confirmed cases, the National Education Association is maintaining a spreadsheet for each state where educators can report cases.
Currently, 121 patients in Utah are hospitalized with COVID-19, one more than on Thursday. Fifty-four of them are in intensive care units. Of the state’s nearly 1,300 ventilators, 208 are now in use. Almost 3,200 people have required hospitalization for the disease in Utah since the outbreak began.
The five deaths reported Friday bring the state’s death toll to 419. Those who died are: A Utah County man between the ages of 65 and 84 who was hospitalized when he died; a Salt Lake County man older than 85 who was a long-term care resident; a Utah County woman between 65-84 who was hospitalized when she died; a Washington County man between 65-84 who was hospitalized when he died; and a Davis County man older than 85 who was hospitalized when he died.
About 45,500 of the Utah’s cases are considered recovered after surviving the three-week point since their diagnoses, meaning about 8,300 cases remain active."

WASHINGTON — U.S. health officials on Friday dropped a controversial piece of coronavirus guidance and said anyone who has been in close contact with an infected person should get tested.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention essentially returned to its previous testing guidance, getting rid of language posted last month that said people didn’t need to get tested if they didn't feel sick. That change had set off a rash of criticism from health experts who couldn't fathom why the nation's top public health agency would say such a thing amid the pandemic.
It was ""not consistent with the basic principles of controlling an epidemic,”said Dr. Silvia Chiang, a pediatric infectious diseases expert at Brown University who applauded the change announced Friday.
The CDC now says anyone who has been within 6 feet of an infected person for at least 15 minutes should get a test. In a statement, the agency called the changes a “clarification” that was needed “due to the significance of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission.”
Agency officials declined additional comment.
Health officials were evasive about why they had made the change in August, and some outside observers speculated it was forced on the CDC by political appointees within the Trump administration.
At the time, administration officials said the language originated at the CDC but the decision came out of meetings of the White House coronavirus task force. Dr. Brett Giroir, an assistant secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services, said many federal leaders outside the agency were involved in “lots of editing, lots of input.” He said it was difficult to attribute the final language to any one source.
The New York Times, citing internal federal documents and unnamed sources, on Thursday reported that the guidance was placed on the CDC’s website over the objections of agency scientists.
Public health experts have noted that testing the contacts of infected people is a core element of efforts to keep outbreaks in check, and that a large percentage of those infected with the coronavirus exhibit no COVID-19 symptoms.
The CDC’s chief, Dr. Robert Redfield, issued a statement shortly after the controversy erupted that did little to clarify why the change was deemed necessary. The main intent seemed to be to assure state health officials that they could continue to recommend that all close contacts be tested if they felt that was wisest, despite the website language that said it was not necessary.
During a U.S. Senate hearing on Wednesday, Redfield continued to defend the language that was dropped Friday. He said the August changes had been “misinterpreted” and were part of an effort to increase engagement by doctors and local health officials in the handling of potential illness clusters.

A total of 119 students came back positive from Sept. 11-17 after 294 caught the virus the previous week. That pushes the UA total to 2,302 since classes began Aug. 19.
In terms of isolation/quarantine space, the school reports 3.88% occupancy.
Numbers also remained low at UAB (18 positives) and UA-Huntsville (19 positives).
There was a slight increase in positive cases among faculty and staff in Tuscaloosa. There were 17 positives this week after 13 last week for a total of 51 since classes started.
University of Alabama System Chancellor Finis St. John spoke Thursday at the trustees meeting about the response to the COVID-19 outbreak on campus.
“We also faced worrisome trends on our campuses, but the difference is we were prepared,” St. John said Thursday. ""We had a plan. We addressed the issues as they arose and we held our nerve despite difficult publicity and calls for us to change course and give up, we trusted our plan and our people. Because we held firm, other college and universities who faced the same difficult trends that we did, did the same.
“So far, staying the course for the good of our students and our state has proven to be the right course.”
The chancellor said of the 433 sentinel tests of a random campus sampling done in Tuscaloosa so far this week, three came back positive. A week before that, two of 245 were positive.

(WMTV) - Monroe High School is moving to virtual instruction for the next two weeks in response to several students and staff testing positive for COVID-19.
Monroe High School students are to attend school virtually from Monday, Sept. 21 through Thursday Oct. 1, described as “PLAN C” by the district.
The district said students at Monroe Middle School, Abraham Lincoln Elementary, Parkside Elementary and Northside Elementary will continue to attend classes following the “PLAN B,"" with students alternating between in-person and virtual instruction from Monday, Sept. 21 through Thursday Oct. 1.
District Administrator Rick Waski said as of early Friday morning three staff members and four students tested positive at the high school. Additionally, 14 students and eight staff are quarantine, making it difficult to continue to hold face-to-face instruction.
“We recognize the challenges this brings and we know that there will be many high school students deeply disappointed,"" Waski said. “However, we know that the numbers will only grow at the high school, and in the community, if we do not make this adjustment to our operational plan at this time.”

Those clarifications have been noted in italic and added to the original story below.
MUNCIE, Ind. (AP) — Within five weeks after students started returning to Ball State University last month, the surrounding county had become Indiana’s coronavirus epicenter.
Out of 610 symptomatic students tested for the virus through IU Health, more than half have been positive. Dozens of infections have been blamed on off-campus parties, prompting university officials to admonish students.
University President Geoffrey Mearns wrote that the cases apparently were tied not to classrooms or dormitories but to “poor personal choices some students are making, primarily off campus.”
“The actions of these students are putting our planned on-campus instruction and activities at risk,” he said.
Similar examples abound in other college towns across the nation. Among the 50 U.S. counties with the highest concentrations of students and overall populations of at least 50,000, 20 have consistently reported higher rates of new virus cases than their states have since Sept. 1, according to an Associated Press analysis.
On average, infection rates in those 20 counties have been more than three times higher than their states’ overall rates.
At James Madison University in Virginia, which recently sent students home through September amid a surge in cases, the county is averaging a weekly infection rate of nearly 90 cases per 100,000 people, or more than eight times the statewide average.
Health officials fear that surges among college students will spread to more vulnerable people — older ones and those with underlying health problems — and trigger a new wave of cases and hospitalizations. Some worry that colleges could overwhelm hospitals already bracing for increasing cases of COVID-19 and flu this fall and winter.
“There’s this waiting game. Does it stay on college campuses or will it escape?” said Dr. Jeff Pothof, chief quality officer at the University of Wisconsin medical center in Madison, where cases among college students have been climbing.
While universities have emerged as hot spots in nearly every state, many of the worst outbreaks have been scattered across the South and Midwest. Of the 50 college counties analyzed by the AP, James Madison’s had the highest infection rate, followed by counties that are home to the University of Georgia, Florida State and Indiana University in Bloomington.
In the 10 counties with the highest infection rates, colleges have reported at least 15,000 cases among students and employees in recent weeks, though testing and reporting practices vary significantly and the actual number is probably much higher.
For many colleges, the return to campus was a carefully orchestrated process that took months to plan and millions of dollars to pull off. But as safe as they’ve made their campuses, many colleges have struggled to curb off-campus gatherings that have been tied to thousands of infections.
Parties were blamed for dozens of cases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which brought students back in early August only to send them home weeks later.
Other schools have cracked down on parties and disciplined students. The University of Missouri in Columbia announced this week that it expelled two students and suspended three others for violating rules meant to slow the virus’s spread.
The outbreaks are increasingly straining relations between universities and their towns.
Amid a spike in cases at the University of Colorado at Boulder, county health authorities Tuesday urged all students to quarantine for two weeks. Students and others at the university have accounted for 76% of the county’s 663 positive cases over the past two weeks, officials said.
“More stringent and mandatory restrictions will be imposed if students do not comply and break the transmission cycle,” Jeffrey Zayach, executive director of Boulder County Public Health, warned in a letter to students.
In a letter to students, the school’s chancellor, Philip DiStefano, warned that the quarantine will be strictly enforced and that students who violate it could face suspension or other discipline. Already, DiStefano said, more than 400 students face university discipline for violating public health orders.
At Miami University in Ohio, county health authorities ordered all of the school’s athletes to isolate for 14 days last month after 27 tested positive for the virus. Last week, local police cited six men at an off-campus house party that included several students who had recently tested positive.
As cases increase at Boston College and the campus runs out of quarantine space, the mayor of nearby Newton is asking the school not to use any of the town’s hotels or other property to isolate students.
Some cities have tightened rules at bars to discourage students from gathering. As cases surged at Illinois State, the town’s mayor issued an order requiring all bar customers to be seated to be served. He also limited gatherings near campus to no more than 10 people.
Still, residents and officials in many college towns are rooting for universities to work through outbreaks and avoid campus closings that could further hurt the local economy.
Fred Pryce, who manages a series of stores in a strip mall near Ball State, said sending students home would hurt the area’s businesses “big time.”
“That’s 20,000-plus potential patrons that will vanish,” Pryce said. “There are ways to keep students in Muncie safely while they do their classes.”
Ball State, roughly 60 miles from Indianapolis, has 21,600 students on a campus of red brick buildings and sleek, modern dorms in Muncie, where the university is the city’s second-largest employer after Ball Memorial Hospital.
On campus last week, sophomore La’Tricia Williams, wearing a mask, said she was glad to be back instead of sitting on the couch with her laptop at her family’s home, taking online classes.
“But I get that it comes with some risk,” she said. “You can give students a whole bunch of rules for what they should and shouldn’t do while they’re back at the school, but they’re not going to stop doing certain things here or going out into the community.”
Caleb Henry, a Ball State junior who lives off campus, said that he and other students have been frequenting local bars and meeting at friends’ houses but that he and most others are behaving responsibly, with masks and social distancing. He said students are being vilified unfairly.
“Everyone seems to be getting upset at college kids right now, accusing us of spreading the virus and making us out to be these highly infectious creatures that need to be sent home,” Henry said. “What about all the other people around town going to bars … having parties, weddings, whatever? We’re only doing the same things they are.”
As cases mounted at Ball State last month, the school tried to ban students from visiting dorms other than their own, but officials reversed the rule after a backlash from students. Even so, officials say infection rates have started to subside, and the school has contingency plans for changing from in-person to totally online.
While some colleges have sent students home amid outbreaks, many others are digging in. Some have moved classes online but urged students to stay where they are until cases drop. Among them is the University of Notre Dame, which paused in-person classes Aug. 18 and moved them online amid a surge that saw as many as 89 new cases per day. Weeks later, after a sharp decrease in infections, classes have started to resume on campus.
Other schools are hoping to replicate that success, including the University of Illinois, the University of Wisconsin and West Virginia University, which recently shifted classes online as the virus spread.
In a recent call with governors, Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, cautioned against sending students home, saying that could spark outbreaks elsewhere.
Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has also endorsed Notre Dame’s approach, saying colleges that “work through it” and find ways to isolate infected students are more likely to “end up in the best place.”
In a letter to students at Ball State this week, the university president thanked students for helping reduce virus rates. Still, he warned: “This data is not a cause for celebration. Rather, this data is a call for continued action.”"

Wastewater from the university's 10 residence halls will be tested once or twice a week for presence of the virus, the university announced Friday. The school's Environmental Research and Innovation Center will collect and process the samples, then ship them off to a private lab for analysis.
“The results from the wastewater testing will be another way to monitor the prevalence of the virus on campus and ... are another data point we can use to make decisions on how to continue to keep the UWO community safe,” University Police Chief Kurt Leibold said in the announcement.
Monitoring wastewater can serve as an early warning of an outbreak, if lab staff identify the virus in the sewage or determine that quantities are increasing.
RELATED: Wastewater samples and antibody testing could be key to understanding COVID-19 in Wisconsin. Two new state studies aim to find out
It may seem like a wacky strategy, but it's not. After research showed the virus can be shed through stool and bodily fluids, studies have appeared in the U.S. and across the world to track the virus in this way. Such a study is underway across the state of Wisconsin and will conclude in June.
And it's especially popular on college campuses, including UW-Madison, which is doing its own wastewater testing this year. At the University of Arizona, the testing alerted a pending outbreak in late August and officials were able to head it off before it spread.
UW-Oshkosh's lab is already collecting wastewater samples from local health care facilities for the same purpose, according to the university.
Residence hall testing will begin soon and is expected to give school leaders an approximate idea of how the virus is moving on campus.
""We’ll get a relative abundance — is it high, low, is there any?” Greg Kleinheinz, director of the lab and professor of environmental engineering technology, said in the announcement. “That’ll help kind of drive what happens next.""

276,https://www.wxyz.com/news/coronavirus/high-school-football-season-kicks-off-looking-different-due-to-covid-19,-0.446,High School Football season kicks off looking different due to COVID-19,"HARTLAND, Mich. (WXYZ) — Friday and Saturday many football teams around metro Detroit will kick off their seasons.
For some it means excitement. For others it is bittersweet. Football will look a bit different than in past years.
There will be social distancing when possible, extra sanitizing of the equipment and temperature checks for players as teams work to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Some regular players and coaches are sitting out due to health concerns.
“Even under their helmets, everyone has to wear a mask now. Everyone has to wear gloves during practice,” said Terrence Moore, a freshman and a kicker on the Detroit Martin Luther King Jr. High School Football Team.
Moore says he is just happy to play.
“I have been playing since I was 6-years-old. I watch it every Saturday with my dad, college football. It means everything,” he said.
“God put me on this earth for a reason and I definitely want to serve these student-athletes. That is why I am here,” said Tyrone Spencer, Detroit Martin Luther King Junior High School Football Coach.
Spencer says he is proud to through football provide character-building mentorship. As a dad of two young boys, he is also nervous.
“I do have a four-month-old at home. That is something I think about all the time,” said the coach who is also a teacher.
He says he will miss thousands of fans cheering the team, especially when the team takes on its rival Cass Tech. The Michigan High School Athletic Association says in parts of the state in Phase 4, like metro Detroit, only two spectators per athlete or participant are allowed.
“Usually at a King-Cass game, it is five thousand people. Now it is only two people per student-athlete,” he said Spencer.
Crowds won’t be the only thing missing.
Pom, dance, marching band, and other related performance groups are not allowed to participate at football games, leaving many disappointed. Some schools are finding new ways to include them in a different way.
At Hartland High School Marching band members say they are planning a virtual performance for social media, but will not be playing at football games.
Pom team members say they are preparing socially distanced routines, but at this point will not be able to share them during half time or the game.
“It is sad because it is all we had to look forward to over the summer,” said Ashley Kretz, who is on the Junior Varsity Pom Team and plays piccolo in the Hartland High School Marching Band.
“Hanging out with your section and all your friends in band,” said Jacob Bialowicz, a junior in the Hartland High Marching band about what he will miss.
“And the half time performances, nothing beats it,” added Hunter Kretz, a senior in the Hartland High School Marching Band.
“I would like Governor Whitmer to say, you know what, for the same reasons it is important for football and cheer to be active, it is the same for the children who do arts and perform,” said Angelina Kretz, a Hartland mom.
Kretz says she is happy with how the district is adjusting to continue to give children in the arts opportunities, but she says the state needs to make sure it doesn’t hold them back with unequal restrictions.

OVERLAND PARK, Kan.--(Business Wire)--Prioritizing the well-being of its stakeholders amid the COVID-19 pandemic, The Barstow School in suburban Kansas City has deployed Black & Veatch’s Rapid Modular Health System (RaMHS) structures to assist with coronavirus screenings of students, faculty and staff.
The RaMHS module represents a swift response to COVID-19 conditions and complements the school’s “Back to Barstow 2020 Return-to-Campus Plan” developed in consultation with the school’s administrative leadership and medical advisory committee. It also illustrates the school’s flexibility and readiness in adapting procedures – including the use of germ-killing ultraviolet wands and lamps – in response to public health recommendations. The RaMHS unit will provide a second location for students to receive daily temperature screenings, making campus arrival and check-in more efficient.
“The Barstow School is pleased to partner with Black & Veatch to offer the innovative RaMHS unit to our school community,” said Shane Foster, president of The Barstow School, which emphasizes science, technology, engineering, math (STEM) and the arts (STEAM). “As we are firmly committed to ensuring the health and safety of our students and to showing them how innovation results in real-world solutions, this partnership provides an effective way to achieve both goals.”
Developed by Black & Veatch – a 105-year-old global infrastructure leader with vast experience in pathogen-tracking methods and the construction of biological safety-related facilities – the RaMHS units are scalable, intermodal containers transformed into comfortable sites for COVID-19 screening and other diagnostic purposes, as well as vaccination distribution and personal protective equipment (PPE) disinfection and dispensing. These windowed modules come in various sizes and configurations, electrical hook-up ready, weather-resistant, climate controlled, and lockable, providing security for personnel and equipment in any environment. The units can be outfitted with the latest in COVID response technology from a variety of partners.
The uniquely adaptable RaMHS module, which provides an alternate testing and screening site outside of traditional emergency room or doctor office settings, gives schools, health-care sites, office parks, government locations, commercial and industrial businesses, and retail locations the peace of mind of having a reliable, affordable coronavirus testing place within days. RaMHS modules already have been put to use by a Kansas City-area health system and by the University of Kansas.
“We applaud The Barstow School’s proactiveness in safeguarding the health and safety for its students and employees,” said Dave Johnson, the RaMHS solutions team leader at Black & Veatch, which also is exploring options to collaborate with Barstow in transforming a former supermarket into an off-campus site. “Through that conversion effort and RaMHS, we look forward to building a continuing partnership with Barstow that shares our passion for STEM and safety.”
The climate-controlled RaMHS modules can be quickly daisy-chained to meet community and regional demands. In conjunction with other personal protective gear, this design can reduce exposure risks. RaMHS also is a hub where personal protection equipment can be disinfected and data can be harvested and analyzed to record and measure where patients have been.
The RaMHS program follows the recent announcement of Black & Veatch’s Growth Accelerator incubator to find and collaborate with startups and other innovators to expedite solutions that soften COVID-19’s impact. As a virtual, remote effort, the 2020 Black & Veatch IgniteX COVID-19 Response Accelerator has engaged companies and entrepreneurs who have real-time ideas about how to mitigate the coronavirus outbreak and need help commercializing, rapidly deploying and scaling those concepts.

An investigation into Lighthouse Baptist Church in Horseheads, N.Y. began on Saturday, Sept. 6 according to the Chemung County Executive Chris Moss.
“This is the most cases we’ve had connected to one incident since we started,” Moss said. “A lot of the parishioners already came forward when they saw it on the news. We were able to get them tested and we’re able to conduct the trace investigations to see what close contact they would have had.”
On Sept 8, the county health department closed the church because of the COVID-19 cluster. In efforts to contact trace the congregation, the county issued a subpoena to the church on Sept 12.
“We had a hard time getting information,” Moss said. “We needed to know who the congregation was—that may have visited the church, so we could do the tracing investigation. We weren’t getting that cooperation, so eventually the county attorney worked with the public health board and they issued a subpoena to the church to have them give the list over.”
According to the Chemung County Health Director, Peter Buzzetti, several members of the church who tested positive attended a wedding in another county.
On Sept 17, Moss confirmed with 18 News a 76-year-old man died from the virus. The man did not go to the church but was in contact with an individual who attended Lighthouse Baptist.
Meanwhile, a class at Howard A. Hanlon Elementary in the Odessa-Montour Central School District developed COVID-19 symptoms. The entire class was told not to come back until testing results came back.
According to the Schuyler County Health Director, Deborah Minor, the student’s test came back positive. The health department said the student was “a close contact” of someone who tested positive for the virus on Friday evening and indirectly connected to the Lighthouse Baptist Church cluster.
18 News reached out to the Odessa Montour Central School District for comment but did not hear back.
One senator said the area needs to remain diligent to avoid a bigger jump in cases.
“This just shows that while things are getting better, we aren’t out of this year,” said New York Senator, Tom O’Mara. “We need to remain diligent with wearing our masks and with the social distancing.”

(AP) — An upstate New York college is suspending in-person classes for two weeks because of a coronavirus outbreak, officials announced Friday, but campus will stay open and students won't be sent home.
The State University of New York at Oswego announced the shift to remote learning beginning Sept. 19 as a proactive measure as it neared the state's shutdown threshold of 100 COVID-19 cases, college president Deborah Stanley said.
SUNY Oswego had tallied 82 virus cases as of Friday and was projected to reach the 100-case mark on Sept. 25, Stanley wrote in a letter to students and staff and posted on the college's website.
“In that light, we determined that taking a pause in order to manage the virus with the goal of containing it on our campus is best for our entire college community,” Stanley wrote in the letter.
The suspension of in-person classes affects the main campus in Oswego and a satellite campus about 34 miles (55 kilometers) south in Syracuse. All extracurricular programs and student activities deemed non-essential are also being suspended.
Stanley said the college plans to resume regular classes on Oct. 5. About 8,000 students attend SUNY Oswego.
In the meantime, she said, students will be required to limit movement to essential needs, such as going to work, medical appointments and to pick up food. They will also continue to have access to labs, studios, health care and other student services.
Another state-run college, SUNY Oneonta, closed its campus Sept. 3 and shifted to online classes for the remainder of the fall semester after seeing nearly 400 cases of coronavirus."

Denton Hall is typically used for first and second-year students. Overall, the campus has had 88 confirmed coronavirus cases since September 6, according to their website.
This comes after the university brought students back to campus for in-person classes on Monday, and the Big 10 Conference announced Wednesday that they would have a football season after all.
The university says that all students have tested positive are in isolation and anyone who was in close contact with these students have been notified and moved to designated quarantine housing.
Students have been asked to restrict their activities and practice enhanced social distancing. The school says students will be provided a case manager and will have access to a variety of resources, including meal delivery."

The State University of New York at Oneonta was forced to cancel in-person classes for the fall earlier this month following the huge COVID-19 outbreak.
Since returning to campus, more than 670 students - a tenth of the student population - have tested positive for COVID-19.
SUNY Oneonta currently has the worst on-campus COVID-19 outbreak in the state and one of the largest in the United States.
Some have blamed the outbreak on the university's lack of COVID-19 screening when students returned to campus and a failure to monitor parties and gatherings that have been held.
A photo that emerged earlier this month drew backlash after it showed about a dozen infected students partying in an isolation dorm on campus.
The photo, which was posted on social media just days after the campus switched to remote learning, showed the group of students drinking and smiling as they posed for the selfie.
SUNY Oneonta president Barbara Jean Morris immediately slammed the photo and vowed to discipline - and possibly suspend - the students involved.
'We have seen the photo taken in one of our residence halls of students blatantly violating our strict safety protocols and code of conduct and putting themselves and others at risk,' Morris said.
'We are working to identify the students and will quickly issue disciplinary actions and possible suspensions. We will also step up our monitoring of these residence halls to prevent this behavior from happening again and to continue to protect the safety and health of our students.
'It is deeply disappointing that following the severe action SUNY Oneonta took just days ago to shift to remote learning for all students, we are still faced with the reckless and irresponsible behavior of a few that are damaging the reputation of our campus and our dedicated students who followed the safety rules every day and were looking forward to a great semester on campus.'

SUNY Oneonta had already suspended a handful of students in late August for organizing parties.
Jim Malatras, SUNY's chancellor, blamed the partying students for the outbreak on campus after more than 100 students - about three percent of the campus population - tested positive for COVID-19.
'We have had reports of several large parties of our students at Oneonta last week, and unfortunately because of those larger gatherings, there were several students who were symptomatic of COVID,' Malatras said at the time.
'Despite the diligence of the vast majority of our SUNY Oneonta students, faculty and staff, the actions of a few individuals who didn't comply resulted in the spread of COVID-19 over the past week.'
The chancellor opted to suspend classes for two weeks on August 30 as a result of the outbreak.
It prompted New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to intervene by sending what he described as a 'SWAT team' to the campus to help control the outbreak.
Five days after suspending classes, the number of cases jumped to more than 500.
Malatras announced on September 5 that the campus would cease all in-person classes and activities for the rest of the fall semester due to the outbreak.
As the university investigates what when wrong with their reopening plan, they are facing accusations they mishandled the COVID-19 outbreak.
Some students and parents have slammed the school's decision not to require proof of a negative test prior to returning to campus.
They also say the university didn't test students once they arrived.
Malatras, who officially became chancellor on August 31, has since said that all SUNY schools will need to develop testing plans ahead of next semester.
Surveillance testing is now also mandatory on all campuses.
Oneonta is one of 64 campuses run by the State University of New York.
There are about 3,000 students based there.
Oneonta is the first to be shut down due to COVID-19 since reopening.

Ryan Malosh, University of Michigan and Nina Masters, University of Michigan Medical School
(THE CONVERSATION) Scientists have learned a few things over the past six months as the COVID-19 pandemic has continued. We’ve learned that the virus that causes COVID-19 transmits particularly well when a group of people are together in a small, poorly ventilated area. We’ve learned that young people are just as susceptible as older people to infection. We’ve learned that if there is widespread community transmission, the virus will find its way to the very places we don’t want it go.
So, it’s not surprising to us, researchers who study diseases that can be prevented by vaccines, that with schools and colleges reopening, the virus is spreading.
These are places designed around the idea of bringing lots of people to one place. Many of them bring people together from all over the world. They are perfect places for disease to spread.
How we got here
Back in March, colleges and universities closed down like everything else except essential businesses. They sent students home. There was a rough transition to online instruction. Students weren’t happy, faculty weren’t happy. And so, they started to come up with plans on how to reopen for in-person instruction for the fall semester.
Many places installed plexi-glass barriers in classrooms, considered mask mandates and worked out physical distancing in lecture halls. Most people realized that professors who taught large classes should plan for remote learning.
University administrators and public health experts started making these plans in the spring. Back then, we scientists and public health researchers all operated under the assumption that community spread would be under some sort of control by fall. We all thought that the country would increase testing capacity, and we have. Then, once new cases dropped to a low level, we could institute contact tracing, the way other countries had.
But that part hasn’t happened. And so now these same colleges and universities are facing huge increases in cases, including at the University of North Carolina, Notre Dame and the University of Alabama. Many universities that have opted to return to in-person classes are also having a surge in cases. These outbreaks will inevitably spread to the wider communities in which the campuses are located.
It seems that for many of these institutions, the priority was on financial concerns, which involved a return to a normal fall semester to the greatest extent possible. They then developed plans that they thought would make this possible. Faculty at manyinstitutions and at least one ethics committee have argued that the priority should have been the safety of students, faculty and the surrounding communities.
While schools across the country have different priorities, enrollments, campus size, and student demographics, many schools share one thing in common: making no real contingency plans around reopening amid COVID-19, other than going remote if governors mandated it.
The schools that did spend the summer figuring out how to deliver high quality education remotely, or how to safely provide housing and access to services for the most vulnerable students, are less likely to have their fall semester disrupted. However, the College Crisis Initiative’s data dashboard found that only 7% of 1,442 four-year schools surveyed were planning on a fully online fall semester.
The challenge ahead
And so, the inevitable has come to pass. Now, many college campuses will struggle to control their outbreaks, because there are a lot of unique challenges inherent to COVID-19 in this population.
Colleges are not nursing homes or prisons. Some are trying to limit contact with the broader community.
But in general, students are not kept under lock and key. They have visitors from other schools. They go back and forth to their parents’ homes. And, yes, they go to parties. To us, blaming students for wanting a normal-ish college experience when the schools themselves have set the tone for trying hard to return to normal isn’t fair.
It’s also true that not all of the contact students have is as irresponsible as some have suggested. Many students hold jobs in the communities that surround the school. And most of these jobs aren’t typically the work-from-home type of job. In our undergraduate careers we both worked at jobs that had high contact rates with the community. And often, when your job is waiting tables at a local pizza place or manning a library desk, most of your colleagues are students as well. All of these factors will make contact tracing very hard.
Public health experts also expect a relatively high proportion of college-aged students to be either completely asymptomatic or to only have very mild symptoms. Without universal testing, these students won’t know they’re sick. They may not isolate if they have mild symptoms. But they will still be able to spread the virus to others. Symptom and temperature screenings may not recognize these individuals as those who need to stay away from campus buildings.
A different kind of campus test
Which brings us to testing. Some places are doing universal testing of students, multiple times per week. But, given the state of testing in the U.S., that is not a realistic possibility for most schools.
Let’s look at our university as an example. The University of Michigan has an undergraduate population of 30,000 students. Let’s assume that two-thirds of them came back to campus. That means 40,000 tests per week just for University of Michigan undergraduate students. Right now the entire state of Michigan is doing a little more than 200,000 diagnostic tests per week. Someschools have developed their own tests to handle this huge increase in capacity. But many university labs are involved in testing for large health systems and the rest of the state too. In these places it becomes very difficult for 1 in 5 tests available in an entire state to be dedicated to the students at a single university.
A scale-up of rapid, at-home antigen tests could be one approach to make testing on this scale feasible. These types of tests have the advantage of detecting highly infectious individuals – making them a good screening tool – but many are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration because they aren’t as sensitive as the standard PCR-based diagnostic test.
[The Conversation’s science, health and technology editors pick their favorite stories. Weekly on Wednesdays.]
If transmission on campus continues to happen mostly outside of the classroom, simply going remote will not solve the problem. Keeping students on campus will be risky. Many students will be attempting to navigate social distancing guidelines without a traditional social support network.
As much as possible, we believe students need to be able to safely return to their homes. But this can’t be done haphazardly. Bringing them to campus was a predictable risk – so is sending them home. As colleges inevitably move back to online instruction, plans must be put in place to minimize the risk of seeding epidemics. Dismissing all students, some of whom are infectious, back to their home communities risks spreading the virus further across the country, a bad outcome for all.
The unique epidemiology of COVID-19 in young adults, along with the contact patterns on college campuses and the inability to effectively screen through symptom reports or diagnostic testing, have left college campuses with few options for safely operating with in-person classes. We know that few wanted an all-remote fall semester, but it’s becoming clear that was probably our best bet.

Cornell officials said the cluster is “related to student gatherings where masks were not worn nor physical distancing observed” at its Ithaca campus
In a message sent to students and faculty on Thursday, the Ivy League school said 36 of the 39 infected COVID-19 were student athletes.
The Cornell cluster comes on the heels of COVID-19 outbreaks reported at New York’s other public and private colleges. The State University of New York at Oneonta scrapped in-person classes and moved all classes online after an outbreak of 300 cases.
“The president’s leadership team learned that the size of this and a related cluster had grown to a total of 39 cases. We expect the size of the clusters to grow further over the coming days as we learn the results of pending tests,” said a joint statement delivered Thursday by Cornell Provost Mike Kotlikoff and Ryan Lombardi, vice president of student and campus life.
The university also reported eight other COVID-19 cases unrelated to the cluster — bringing the total to 47.
Cornell has gone on “yellow alert” and is restricting student gatherings to a maximum of 10 people.
“While these clusters represent approximately only 0.1% of our campus population, and a very small percentage of our student athletes, it points to a dangerous disregard by a group of students for the behavioral guidelines that we established to protect the public health of our community,” the Cornell officials said.
In conjunction with the local Tompkins County Health Department, Cornell said it has ramped up testing and contact tracing beyond those who were exposed to the infected students in a bid to contain the spread — particularly members of its athletic teams.
“As disheartening as it is to learn of these positive cases, our screening program is working. All of the infected students are in isolation and being supported, and their contacts are being quarantined to prevent additional spread. Importantly, we do not believe the new infections have spread outside the student community,” the Cornell officials said.
But the Cornell leaders emphasized that “all is not well” and blasted students for reckless behavior during the pandemic.
“This episode demonstrates exactly what President [Martha] Pollack said in her message last night: that there is the potential for just a few small student gatherings to destroy all our plans for an in-person semester,” they said.
“Although we are currently still in a manageable situation, the rapid growth of cases in these recent clusters puts us perilously close to needing to take drastic action, such as moving to wholly online classes for a period of time.”
In the letter, the officials said Cornell has suspended and banned students who engaged in “irresponsible behavior and disregard for others in our community.”
“All of us share a responsibility to conduct ourselves in ways that do not put others at risk, and we cannot allow the actions of a few to ruin the possibility of an in-person semester and risk the health and safety of our community,” they said.
One Cornell professor said the outbreak on campus was troubling.
“Cornell is a well-resourced Ivy League institution with all the protocols, testing and contact tracing in place. What does this mean for our public schools?,” the instructor told The Post.
Based on outbreaks at colleges, Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Monday predicted that some K-12 schools will have to close buildings and switch totally to online classes. He called outbreaks among college students “the canary in the coal mine,” adding, “I think it is going to be replicated in K-12.”
Mayor Bill de Blasio has delayed the opening of New York City schools until Sept. 21 amid a tug-of-war with the unions on whether there should be in-person instruction."

In a statement released Thursday, Temple said there will be exceptions for classes that cannot be held virtually. School officials say 95% of the classes will be conducted remotely.
A two-week suspension was put in place earlier this week after a spike in positive COVID-19 test results over the weekend.
""In light of the recent increase in positive test results among our students, and after consultation with our own healthcare professionals and leaders at the Philadelphia Department of Public Health, we have concluded that the data indicate it is time to pivot to primarily online education, as we said we would be prepared to do,"" President Richard Englert and Executive Vice President and Provost JoAnne Epps said in a statement.
The university said the students who tested positive either had no symptoms or mild to moderate flu-like symptoms.
Some parents, like the Delucas from Rockledge, Pennsylvania are choosing to get their college student off campus and back home.
""We weren't sure how long it would be. We weren't sure something like this would happen. I think we sort of planned for it,"" said Michael Deluca, who will be getting a full refund from Temple for their daughter's room and board.
In a news conference on Tuesday, Philadelphia Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas Farley had asked Temple students to ""assume everyone around you is infected.""
The number of positive cases rose from just over 50 on Friday to more than 200 by Wednesday.
Farley said contact tracing suggests the outbreak was primarily coming from off-campus apartments with multiple residents and small social gatherings around campus.
Student Max Culp says, ""I've seen people post on their stories on Snapchat like you know 'party at this address but I'm not going to tell you the address, you have to be trusted to go in there.'""

University officials said that students and their families seeking reimbursement for on campus housing will have that option. If a student moves out by Sept. 13 the entire room and board fee will be refunded.
Residence halls will also remain open to students who, for any number of reasons, may be unable to return home"

The young are the most likely to get the coronavirus but the least likely to die from it.
CU Boulder, police cracking down on public health violations
In the last week, outbreaks have taken place at Colorado State University, University of Colorado Boulder and Regis University. The outbreaks interrupt what is otherwise a downward trend in COVID-19 numbers.
Last week marked the lowest week ever for COVID-19 hospital admissions. Weekly death totals have leveled off, and daily death totals are at their all-time lowest. Colorado hospitals admitted 65 new coronavirus patients last week – down 47% from the previous week. This is the largest weekly drop in new admissions from one week to another.
Large outbreaks at Colorado colleges and universities bruise a picture of improving conditions, but statistics do not support fears of widespread death. COVID-19 data shows that these outbreaks are not surprising, but also that they do not necessarily lead up a large spike of hospitalizations and deaths.
COVID-19 has not been very fatal for the typical university age group of 18-22.
The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment groups ages into decades for coronavirus tracking data. Prime age adults have the highest infections rates.
Colleges house the most infected age group in Colorado. Together, 20-29-year-olds represent 22% of the state’s COVID-19 infections – the highest rate of any age bracket.
Incidentally, they also house one of the lowest-infected age brackets. The 10-19-year-olds that make up freshman and sophomore classes make up 9% of the state’s infections.
They state does not release hospital admissions data by age group, but death rates show a different trend than infections.
Despite being the most-infected age group, 20-29-year-olds are among the least likely to die. The age bracket makes up 0.75% of the state’s coronavirus deaths. The 10-19-year-old age group makes up only 0.15% of Colorado pandemic deaths.
Only children under 10 make up a smaller share of COVID-19 deaths – the state has not recorded any.
Data does not show a strong correlation between large infection upticks and large hospitalization or death upticks, but there is a minor one.
Colorado COVID-19 infections were large in April, but infections swelled beyond April’s number in July. Deaths and hospitalizations, however, remain concentrated in April.
In April, the highest weekly case count was 3,638 the week of April 19. The highest-ever seven-day average death rate came on April 14, when the seven-day average was 34 deaths per day. This matches the time of the highest hospitalization rate.
In July, deaths inched upward slightly as infections ballooned beyond April.
Weekly case counts peaked at 4,278 cases the week of July 19, then 3,551 cases the week of July 26, and 3,244 the week of July 12.
Through the high case counts in July and August, the 7-day averages of COVID-19 deaths trended slightly upward from three to four or five."
286,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/covid19-transmission-school-alberta-1.5729819,-2.109,Alberta identifies first likely case of COVID-19 transmission within school,"Alberta has identified its first likely case of COVID-19 transmission within a school, the province's top doctor said Friday.
The second case at Edmonton's Waverley School was likely transmitted from another individual at the school who has tested positive, Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Alberta's chief medical officer of health, said at a news conference.
Hinshaw said both individuals were infectious within the school and that one of them ""seems to have been the source for the other. Although it is difficult to say with 100 per cent certainty where transmission happens, given the facts in this situation, it seems to be a likely situation.""
Transmission within a school ""was not unexpected and is not a cause for alarm,"" Hinshaw said.
""However, I know many are anxious about school safety and I felt it was important to share this information with you and to talk about what it means.""
Waverley School is a public elementary school in the Kenilworth neighbourhood in southeast Edmonton. Last year it had about 170 students.
Edmonton Public Schools said about 12 students from a combined Grade 1/2 class and seven staff members will now isolate at home for 14 days, monitor for symptoms and be tested.
""It was expected. I just didn't expect it to happen maybe so soon. This is the first school for it to happen to in the province and it's my kids' school,"" said parent Vanessa Kelly.
""We're not even a month in and I want to pull them out now.""
School board officials said the school has been thoroughly cleaned and they're confident their back-to-school plan is appropriate for now.
""We knew as we prepared to go back to school that there would be COVID-19 cases at our school,"" said Nancy Petersen, managing director of strategic district supports with Edmonton Pubic Schools, at a news conference Friday.
""We are simply a microcosm of the broader Edmonton community and right now in Edmonton, we continue to have cases of COVID-19. In fact, we have very high numbers right now so we knew that we would also have cases in our schools.""
Hinshaw said that as of Friday morning, 78 individuals attended school while infectious with COVID-19. She said 57 of Alberta's 2,415 schools have reported having one or more of those infectious cases.
She said that to date, none of the cases that have been reported as being infectious while in a school have been sick enough to require any kind of acute care treatment. ""None that I know of have been in hospital or in ICU.""
'Shaming and blaming'
Hinshaw said cases of COVID-19 in schools can lead to ""shaming and blaming,"" which in turn causes anxiety for people in the school community.
When two cases at Lester B. Pearson High School in Calgary earlier this week prompted officials to declare Alberta's first school outbreak, Hinshaw said the school received quite a bit of attention and there were ""lots of people implying that people who attended that high school weren't safe to be around or that the school itself was perhaps a bad environment.""
Similarly, when St. Wilfrid elementary in Calgary was put under a watch, she said that officials ""did still hear reports of the stress and anxiety in parents and students.""
Despite Waverley School having the first likely case of in-school transmission in Alberta, the people in the school community ""are no different from anyone else,"" Hinshaw said.
""They're doing the best that they can. This just happens to be the first place where this transmission happened. It doesn't mean the school is bad or wrong, and the people who attend this school should not be treated as if they themselves have done something wrong.""
The danger with what she called ""this tendency to point fingers"" is that people may choose not to get tested or to disclose symptoms.
""If COVID-19 goes underground, and we're not able to understand how it is spreading, it will cause more harm. I really want to advocate for the collective approach to support and encourage each other and when we identify where an error is made, we do our best to address and move forward.""
On Friday, the province reported 107 new cases, making 1,424 active cases, and one additional death.
An Alberta Health spokesperson said a woman in her 50s from the North zone is dead. Her death is not linked to any outbreak.
The regional breakdown of active cases is:
Edmonton zone: 711
Calgary zone: 450
North zone: 197
South zone: 38
Central zone: 24
Unknown: 4"
