The school has followed testing, isolation, and quarantine protocols, she added, and has conducted &ldquo;thousands of initial tests&rdquo; while beginning surveillance and other testing.</p>\n<p>But Cuomo spokesman Jack Sterne countered that Hofstra's confirmed cases are up to 74 among the student body.
