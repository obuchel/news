Only 23 people had tested positive before that date.\n\"This is an urgent situation,\" said Ingham County Health Officer Linda S. Vail. \"The exponential growth of COVID-19 cases must stop.\"\nThe outbreak started as students returned to the East Lansing area for the fall semester, the department said. Most MSU classes are online but \"many students had binding off-campus leases or simply desired to physically return to the university community.\"\n\"MSU is committed to doing everything we can to prevent the spread of COVID-19,\" Michigan State University Physician David Weismantel said in the statement. \"The safety of our entire community is a priority and we all have a role to play in preventing the spread of the virus. This recommendation from the health department is another tool to help us do just that.\"\nThe quarantine recommendation isn't an \"emergency order,\" but the health department warned that \"more stringent and mandatory restrictions will be imposed if students do not comply and break the transmission cycle.\"\nThe health department said it will look at houses licensed for more than 10 unrelated people \"to see if additional measures are warranted.\"\n\"I am concerned about the health and safety of the MSU community and importantly, I am seriously concerned that unchecked transmission locally will affect the health and safety of all Ingham County residents,\" Vail said.\nEast Lansing Mayor Aaron Stephens, in a statement, urged students to consider their role in halting the \"community spread and, ultimately, saving lives.\"\nHe added: \"We are still seeing far too many social gatherings in the off-campus community, where individuals are in close contact without face coverings.\"\nStudents are asked to self-quarantine for 14 days, until 11:59 p.m. on Saturday, September 26. They are permitted to attend \"in-person instruction, labs, and intercollegiate athletic training,\" the health department said.\n\"They may also leave their homes to work or to obtain food, medicine, medical care, or supplies that are needed to sustain or protect life when such cannot be obtained via delivery,\" the health department added.\nThe entire MSU football team was placed under 14-day quarantine on July 23 after a second staff member and student-athlete tested positive for Covid-19. _ https://www.gwinnettdailypost.com/news/world_nation/michigan-state-university-students-asked-to-self-quarantine-after-covid-19-outbreak/article_6e2f32ef-ebdc-52c0-86a8-6e30423144d3.html _ Gwinnett Daily Post _ 2020-09-12 | Michigan State athletics has 46 positive <b>COVID-19</b> cases among 400 tests _ As Michigan State begins to prepare for a football season that was resurrected this week, it announced its largest number of positive COVID-19 cases since testing began in mid-June.\nThe school conducted 400 COVID-19 tests from Sept. 7-14 on student-athletes and staff members resulting in a total of 46 positive tests. Of those tests, 376 were administered to student-athletes and 45 came back positive. Twenty-four staff members were tested, with one positive test.\nThe results come the same week the Ingham County Health Department recommended all Michigan State University students self-quarantine to contain a coronavirus outbreak from which at least 342 people have tested positive for the disease since Aug. 24. It also mandated that 30 large houses quarantine for 14 days, include 23 fraternity or sorority houses and seven rental houses.\nOn Thursday, 11 more large houses in East Lansing with known exposure to COVID-19 were ordered to quarantine for the next two weeks. That brought the total to 39 large houses under mandatory quarantine after two were previously removed from the list following further investigation.\nStudent-athletes that test positive will have daily check-ins with athletic training staff while the individuals remain in isolation, with additional services provided as directed by the medical and administrative staffs. Further testing and physician follow-up will be required prior to returning to any level of workouts.\nSince the beginning of June, Michigan State has conducted more than 1,950 COVID-19 tests on student-athletes and staff members. There have been more than 1,610 tests on student-athletes, with 93 positive results. Since June 15, there have been more than 333 tests on staff members, at locations both on and off campus, with six positive results. _ https://www.detroitnews.com/story/sports/college/michigan-state-university/spartans/2020/09/18/michigan-state-athletics-has-46-positive-covid-19-cases-among-400-tests/5829977002/ _ Detroit News _ 2020-09-18 | Michigan State reports 12% positivity rate among athletes in latest <b>COVID-19</b> testing round _ As the Big Ten was on the cusp of announcing the reinstatement of the football season, nearly 12% of the 376 Michigan State student-athletes tested for COVID-19 were found to have been infected.\nThe 45 positive results were returned after samples were taken Sept. 7-14, the university said Friday.\nMeanwhile, there was only one case among the 24 staff members checked for the novel coronavirus during the same period.\n[ Michigan State football had 'exhausting' offseason. Now the real work begins. ]\nLast Saturday, Ingham County health officials urged Michigan State students to quarantine after an outbreak in East Lansing. Mandatory lockdowns were also issued for large properties in the area.\nThe orders came shortly before the Big Ten announced Wednesday that football would return with stringent protocols.\n[ Mitch Albom: Big Ten changes course on football \u2014 but why? ]\nUnder the new guidelines, teams would have to stop practice for at least a week if the positivity rate based on a seven-day rolling average exceeded 5% among players and 7.5% within the entire program. The last number will be determined by dividing the number of positive individuals by the total population at risk.\n\u201cI do think that it's going to be very, very critical that our student-athletes, our coaches, everybody that might be around our team is following all the rules; wearing their masks, being distant from each other when possible, washing their hands regularly, all the sort of basic things, staying away from parties and large gatherings,\u201d Michigan State athletic director Bill Beekman said this week. \u201cAnd frankly, even small gatherings. Some of our student-athletes that have tested positive recently weren't at events that were 100 people at a bar, it was three or four friends getting together in an apartment to play cards. But even those seemingly innocent things can pass the virus.\n\u201cAnd I think, frankly, that's a message for everybody in our community. We need to be responsible. And if we're responsible, then we'll be able to field a team and play the games. And if we're not, we won't and we'll have to deal with the consequences of that.\u201d\nMichigan State's football team has already been scarred by COVID-19, having endured a two-week quarantine that began in July.\nSince early June, the university has administered more than 1,950 COVID-19 tests on student-athletes and athletic department staff members. Ninety-nine positive results have been returned.\n\"We trust our medical folks, and we're going to follow our protocols to the best of our ability,\" Spartans football coach Mel Tucker said. \"Behavior modification is something that we talk about constantly with our players, and then we're going to move forward boldly and be ready to adapt and change and adjust as needed going throughout this season.\"\nContact Rainer Sabin at rsabin@freepress.com.

Those schools are spread out across the state \u2014 GVSU is on the west side, CMU and MSU are mid-Michigan, and Adrian is in the southeast.\nMSU is the only one of this group to not be holding in-person classes or hosting large numbers of students in residence halls, but has a considerable number of students living off-campus.\nThe state isn't surprised to see the numbers, Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, the state's chief medical executive and chief deputy for health, told the Free Press.\n\"I think it was what a lot of people expected,\" she said. \"All it takes is one person who is infected to spread it.\n\"It's about an entire lifestyle,\" she said, adding that included students going out and partying without masks. \"That's what we're seeing across the state. I know there are many college students who are doing the right thing. I would encourage everyone to\" wear a mask and maintain social distancing.\nThe data shows the state \"is still in the middle of the pandemic,\" Khaldun told the Free Press. \"It is concerning what we are seeing. It's a reminder that people have to be intentional about practicing\" good behaviors.\nThe numbers\nMonday was the first time the state has published the names and locations of schools with outbreaks. It said it would update the data at 3 p.m. every Monday. The numbers in the state data may be different from what a school itself discloses elsewhere because of differing reporting requirements.\nSee the data with schools and numbers:Tracking coronavirus outbreaks in Michigan schools\nThe state data comes from 45 local health departments. A COVID-19 outbreak is defined as two or more cases with a link by place and time indicating a shared exposure outside of a household, the state said in a news release. The numbers tied to a school are those thought \u2014 through contact tracing \u2014 to have been exposed through a school.\nStudents or staff exposed to COVID-19 outside a school building who are not thought to have spread the virus in school due to quarantine or self-isolation are not included in the data.\nThe data has some limitations, Khaldun said. Just because a school isn't listed doesn't mean there aren't students or staff with positive tests. It just means that either contact tracing couldn't identify where they were exposed or that they were exposed and not linked to the school.\n\"This information does not provide a complete picture of school outbreaks in Michigan and the absence of identified outbreaks in a school does not mean it is not experiencing an outbreak,\" the state said in its release.\nOutbreaks can be difficult to predict, said Dr. Rob Davidson, a western Michigan emergency room physician and executive director of the Committee to Protect Medicare.\n\u201cYou always prepare for the worst and hope for the best,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cAnd if you prepare for the worst and it doesn't happen, everyone thinks you've overdone it.\n\u201cMy concern isn't that the whole state will become one big hot spot. My concern is there will be communities that have significant outbreaks related to kids going back to school. We don't know where they'll be. We don't know how many and when they will exactly occur, but through this fall, we're going to see community transmission. And in places where I work in rural west Michigan the concern would be do we have enough cases that then overrun your hospital, which is always the thing we've been trying to avoid from the beginning.\u201d\nIt's vital, he said, for public health officials to be transparent about cases and outbreaks, and the MDHHS report is a good first step. But, he said, it\u2019s challenging to get accurate data when testing capability is limited by shortages of swabs and reagents.\n\u201cI think they're fully aware that it's almost certainly an underreporting simply because of their inability to adequately test,\u201d he said. \u201cI think if you juxtapose what's happening in Michigan compared to what's happening in Florida, we are light years beyond them. Their governor is actively asking schools not to report cases and some are defying that and actually quoting numbers. So I think that we want to get the numbers out there. I think that's a great place to be. It would just be nice if the capability of testing could keep up with the actual pandemic and then we'd have a better idea of what's really going on.\u201d\nColleges see spread\nOn the first weekend after classes started, Mount Pleasant was awash in Central Michigan University students partying and gathering without masks. On that Saturday night in August, the Free Press observedstudents gathered outside of apartment buildings off campus, drinking, playing beer pong and hanging out, almost completely without masks.\nOn campus, a large pickup basketball game \u2014 in most times a healthy choice for students to make \u2014 had broken out. Most of the two dozen players were unmasked.\nA rapid spike in cases followed that weekend, prompting the local health department to issue a local health emergency banning large gatherings.\nBut Central wasn't alone in seeing outbreaks.\nAt Adrian College, a small liberal arts college about 90 minutes southwest of Detroit, students told the Free Press of large gatherings and of students with positive cases being quarantined in dorms with students who hadn't tested positive.\nAt Grand Valley, administrators said the large numbers were coming from counting students who were living off-campus.\n\"It has been reported that Grand Valley has the highest number of COVID cases among Michigan\u2019s public universities. This is because we count the known condition of all our students, while many other colleges count only the students living on campus,\" Greg Sanial, vice president for finance and administration and interim director of the Virus Action Team, told an internal GVSU publication. \"If we reported only our on-campus numbers, we would have one of the lowest numbers of reported cases.\"\nMSU's spike comes despite having online-only undergraduate classes. Students are still living in off campus housing and late last week, the health department urged anyone who had been to MSU's campus to quarantine for 14 days.\nDr. Peter Gulick, an infectious disease specialist and associate professor of medicine at Michigan State University\u2019s College of Osteopathic Medicine, said that although seeing 1,422 new or ongoing outbreaks at the state\u2019s K-12 schools and universities might seem alarming, transparency should be an essential first step in the public health response.\n\u201cWe have to be transparent,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to make sure everybody hears about these things. I think the reporting is good, but then making sure that we act on what we report, that we find out where those cases are, and then we do something about it\u201d is even more vital to contain the spread of the virus. \u201cYou have to try to find out where those cases are located, and isolate them and quarantine them.\u201d\nAt MSU, Gulick said more than one-third of the cases are tied to sorority and fraternity gatherings.\n\u201cIt\u2019s students gathering together in groups, not practicing the recommended precautions because they're just not afraid of it are just not aware of it,\u201d Gulick said. \u201cThe president of the university pretty much said now everybody's going to be under quarantine because this can be just the beginning of a large spike \u2026 if we're not careful and we don't control things. When you start getting spikes like that, you\u2019ve got to look at the whole situation and try to find out what the reason was for this occurring and put a lid on it right away because it could accelerate into a major outbreak.\u201d\nAnd while schoolchildren and young adults aren\u2019t as likely to be hospitalized, need ventilator care or die of COVID-19 as older people and those with preexisting health conditions, Gulick said there\u2019s still a risk that students can spread the virus to more vulnerable populations.\n\u201cThat is the fear of what's going to happen in the fall with the schools,\u201d he said. \u201cThose young individuals can spread it to high-risk people, like the elderly, like ones with co-morbid conditions. And then we start to fill up the hospitals again. We don't want to do that with the next spike. I do think the fall is going to bring another spike.\n\u201cHopefully, it'll be a spike with a death rate that is low and hospitalization rates that are also low. Maybe the case counts will be up a little bit, but we need to contain that. We don't want to it to spread to as many high-risk people again because that's where you really run into issues.\u201d\nTesting both symptomatic and asymptomatic people, along with contact tracing, isolation and quarantining are the keys to controlling the spread of the virus, he said.\n\u201cAnywhere from 10% to 40% of COVID-19 infections occur in individuals that may not have symptoms of COVID-19,\u201d Gulick said. \u201cThat's how we're going to discover more of these people is by testing more, recognizing these cases and isolating them in quarantine and then getting their contacts isolated as well.\u201d\nFewer cases in K-12\nThere are fewer outbreaks listed in K-12 schools across the state, according to the new state data.\nThe largest K-12 outbreak listed in state data is at Luce Road Elementary School in Alma, where there are six cases, involving both students and staff.\nA Sept. 5 letter to parents from the district acknowledged there were two cases found in a first-grade classroom at the school. A separate letter from the local health department states the cases were connected to staff members. Neither letter references six confirmed cases or that students were also affected.\nIn each letter, the district and health department announced the school would be temporarily closed. While students at the school transitioned to an online education model after the closure, the letter stated the district planned to return to in-person education at the school on Friday.\n\"We understand how hard it is for families to make alternate arrangements on short notice and we appreciate your help in stopping the spread of the disease through this quick action,\" Jennifer Morse, a local medical director, noted in her letter to parents.\nParents responding to the letter on Facebook offered mixed reactions, from thanking the district for being transparent to frustration over the district's handling of the information.\nNo other K-12 school had more than four confirmed cases, according to the state.\nMost of the districts with outbreaks are offering a blended/hybrid model of in-person and online classes. It was not immediately clear whether the students or staff who have COVID-19 were at school, or all in the same classroom.\nNo Detroit Public Schools Community District schools were included on the list.\nKhaldun said she knows schools are doing their best to make sure students are masked when in classrooms, are keeping social distance and doing additional cleaning.\nHowever, she said that needs to happen not only at school, but also at home, where parents need to make sure students aren't being exposed to the virus.\nOther ways to monitor\nState Rep. Darrin Camilleri, D-Brownstown Township, the minority vice-chairman of the House Education Committee, said the numbers at colleges show administrators need to be doing everything they can in the areas of contact tracing and infection monitoring to ensure outbreaks are brought under control quickly.\nOne method Camilleri has heard about \u2014 and would like Michigan university administrators to explore \u2014 involves testing wastewater from on-campus student housing units to quickly detect whether a student who lives in the dorm might have COVID-19. Such testing has been used in Illinois and Utah, as well as other states.\nAnother possibility, Camilleri said, is opt-in cellphone technology that would alert students when they are potentially coming into contact with the virus.\n\u201cWe need to be mindful of privacy,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to force that type of monitoring.\u201d\nMayors of college towns should also make sure they are doing everything they can to monitor and if necessary, shut down, off-campus gatherings, he said.\nAt the K-12 level, Camilleri said he is pleased to see the return to class appears to be going relatively well, so far.\n\u201cAs long as teachers have PPE and students have PPE, and everyone is complying, I think there are cases where it can be safe\u201d to return to classrooms, he said.\nBut as a former teacher, Camilleri said he is concerned that initially strong compliance may get lax over time, resulting in more outbreaks.\nContact David Jesse: 313-222-8851 or djesse@freepress.com.

We\u2019ve learned that the virus that causes COVID-19 transmits particularly well when a group of people are together in a small, poorly ventilated area. We\u2019ve learned that young people are just as susceptible as older people to infection. We\u2019ve learned that if there is widespread community transmission, the virus will find its way to the very places we don\u2019t want it go.\nSo, it\u2019s not surprising to us, researchers who study diseases that can be prevented by vaccines, that with schools and colleges reopening, the virus is spreading.\nThese are places designed around the idea of bringing lots of people to one place. Many of them bring people together from all over the world. They are perfect places for disease to spread.\nHow we got here\nBack in March, colleges and universities closed down like everything else except essential businesses. They sent students home. There was a rough transition to online instruction. Students weren\u2019t happy, faculty weren\u2019t happy. And so, they started to come up with plans on how to reopen for in-person instruction for the fall semester.\nMany places installed plexi-glass barriers in classrooms, considered mask mandates and worked out physical distancing in lecture halls. Most people realized that professors who taught large classes should plan for remote learning.\nUniversity administrators and public health experts started making these plans in the spring. Back then, we scientists and public health researchers all operated under the assumption that community spread would be under some sort of control by fall. We all thought that the country would increase testing capacity, and we have. Then, once new cases dropped to a low level, we could institute contact tracing, the way other countries had.\nBut that part hasn\u2019t happened. And so now these same colleges and universities are facing huge increases in cases, including at the University of North Carolina, Notre Dame and the University of Alabama. Many universities that have opted to return to in-person classes are also having a surge in cases. These outbreaks will inevitably spread to the wider communities in which the campuses are located.\nIt seems that for many of these institutions, the priority was on financial concerns, which involved a return to a normal fall semester to the greatest extent possible. They then developed plans that they thought would make this possible. Faculty at manyinstitutions and at least one ethics committee have argued that the priority should have been the safety of students, faculty and the surrounding communities.\nWhile schools across the country have different priorities, enrollments, campus size, and student demographics, many schools share one thing in common: making no real contingency plans around reopening amid COVID-19, other than going remote if governors mandated it.\nThe schools that did spend the summer figuring out how to deliver high quality education remotely, or how to safely provide housing and access to services for the most vulnerable students, are less likely to have their fall semester disrupted. However, the College Crisis Initiative\u2019s data dashboard found that only 7% of 1,442 four-year schools surveyed were planning on a fully online fall semester.\nThe challenge ahead\nAnd so, the inevitable has come to pass. Now, many college campuses will struggle to control their outbreaks, because there are a lot of unique challenges inherent to COVID-19 in this population.\nColleges are not nursing homes or prisons. Some are trying to limit contact with the broader community.\nBut in general, students are not kept under lock and key. They have visitors from other schools. They go back and forth to their parents\u2019 homes. And, yes, they go to parties. To us, blaming students for wanting a normal-ish college experience when the schools themselves have set the tone for trying hard to return to normal isn\u2019t fair.\nIt\u2019s also true that not all of the contact students have is as irresponsible as some have suggested. Many students hold jobs in the communities that surround the school. And most of these jobs aren\u2019t typically the work-from-home type of job. In our undergraduate careers we both worked at jobs that had high contact rates with the community. And often, when your job is waiting tables at a local pizza place or manning a library desk, most of your colleagues are students as well. All of these factors will make contact tracing very hard.\nPublic health experts also expect a relatively high proportion of college-aged students to be either completely asymptomatic or to only have very mild symptoms. Without universal testing, these students won\u2019t know they\u2019re sick. They may not isolate if they have mild symptoms. But they will still be able to spread the virus to others. Symptom and temperature screenings may not recognize these individuals as those who need to stay away from campus buildings.\nA different kind of campus test\nWhich brings us to testing. Some places are doing universal testing of students, multiple times per week. But, given the state of testing in the U.S., that is not a realistic possibility for most schools.\nLet\u2019s look at our university as an example. The University of Michigan has an undergraduate population of 30,000 students. Let\u2019s assume that two-thirds of them came back to campus. That means 40,000 tests per week just for University of Michigan undergraduate students. Right now the entire state of Michigan is doing a little more than 200,000 diagnostic tests per week. Someschools have developed their own tests to handle this huge increase in capacity. But many university labs are involved in testing for large health systems and the rest of the state too. In these places it becomes very difficult for 1 in 5 tests available in an entire state to be dedicated to the students at a single university.\nA scale-up of rapid, at-home antigen tests could be one approach to make testing on this scale feasible. These types of tests have the advantage of detecting highly infectious individuals \u2013 making them a good screening tool \u2013 but many are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration because they aren\u2019t as sensitive as the standard PCR-based diagnostic test.\n[The Conversation\u2019s science, health and technology editors pick their favorite stories. Weekly on Wednesdays.]\nIf transmission on campus continues to happen mostly outside of the classroom, simply going remote will not solve the problem. Keeping students on campus will be risky. Many students will be attempting to navigate social distancing guidelines without a traditional social support network.\nAs much as possible, we believe students need to be able to safely return to their homes. But this can\u2019t be done haphazardly. Bringing them to campus was a predictable risk \u2013 so is sending them home. As colleges inevitably move back to online instruction, plans must be put in place to minimize the risk of seeding epidemics. Dismissing all students, some of whom are infectious, back to their home communities risks spreading the virus further across the country, a bad outcome for all.\nThe unique epidemiology of COVID-19 in young adults, along with the contact patterns on college campuses and the inability to effectively screen through symptom reports or diagnostic testing, have left college campuses with few options for safely operating with in-person classes. We know that few wanted an all-remote fall semester, but it\u2019s becoming clear that was probably our best bet.\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

A complete count of cases associated with the Temple University outbreak isn\u2019t available, he noted, as some instances are reported with a student\u2019s home address outside of the college area.\nFarley still believes much of the increase across the city in the past week is linked to Temple's outbreak, following a statewide and national trend in coronavirus surges tied to college campuses, he said. Based on data from the week ending Aug. 28, Philadelphia has an average of 108 new Covid cases per day with a 4.1% positive testing rate.\nAs of Thursday afternoon, Temple indicated 236 students and one university employee had tested positive for Covid-19.\nDuring a press conference Thursday, Mayor Jim Kenney said the school decided to move classes online based on the data available and without pressure from the city.\nCity officials also reminded residents of Temple University\u2019s efforts to help mitigate the spread of Covid-19 in Philadelphia, including converting its Liacouras Center into a temporary coronavirus overflow medical facility during the peak of the local health crisis in spring.\nRestaurants in Philadelphia can move ahead with plans to jumpstart indoor dining at 25% capacity the day after Labor Day weekend, while movie theaters must not exceed 50% occupancy and also can allow no more than 25 people at a screening.\nThe greenlight for indoor dining comes as the Rittenhouse Square neighborhood expands outdoor dining options this weekend with temporary street closures and Center City ramps up for its Restaurant Week running Sept. 13-25.\nKenney, who came under fire this week for dining indoors in Maryland while the service was still prohibited in Philly, said he doesn\u2019t anticipate Restaurant Week will increase the risk of Covid-19 spread.\n\u201cIf the [restaurant] capacities are the same as they are and the requirements for indoor dining and all the protocols are followed, it should be as safe as possible,\u201d Kenney said.\nMeanwhile, city officials also fielded questions about the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's notice to states urging them to prepare a strategy for distribution of a potential vaccine to vulnerable populations as soon as late October or early November.\nA vaccine is not yet a certainty and the city has seen no data about safety or effectiveness, Farley said. When that data becomes available he noted the city will work with health experts to formulate a recommendation on the vaccine\u2019s use.\nTo meet the fall timeline, the vaccine would forego Phase 3 clinical trials that involve tens of thousands of people, a critical component in vaccine development and safety testing.\nFarley said he is worried about political motivations at the federal level to debut the vaccine ahead of Election Day.\n\u201cAll I can say is that I will evaluate the data that's available when and if a vaccine is authorized for use and make the recommendations based upon my assessment and speaking to experts around the country as well,\u201d Farley said. _ https://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2020/09/03/indoor-dining-continues-temple-coronavirus-spike.html _ The Business Journals _ 2020-09-03 | Temple <b>University</b> moves almost all classes online for remainder of fall semester after <b>Covid-19</b> <b>outbreak</b> _ Temple University will shift almost all classes to virtual learning for the rest of the fall semester after an outbreak of Covid-19 caused more than 200 students to test positive for the coronavirus in recent days.\nThe news comes just four days after the school suspended in-person classes for two weeks following an initial spike of more than 100 cases on campus, which it attributed to off-campus student gatherings.\nThat figure has since grown to 211 students as of Wednesday afternoon, the last time Temple's Covid-19 dashboard was updated. No employees have tested positive.\nThe rise in cases, as well as consultations with the Philadelphia Department of Public Health, spurred the school to \"pivot to primarily online education, as we said we would be prepared to do,\" President Richard Englert and Provost JoAnne Epps said in a letter to the campus community Thursday morning.\nThe students who have tested positive have shown either \"no or mild to moderate\" flu-like symptoms, they said.\nOnly Temple classes that are essential to be held in-person will be allow to meet, representing just about 5% of the school's overall course offerings.\nStudents will be allowed to stay in their on-campus residences, the school said, to accommodate those who want to retain access to campus resources or are concerned about returning home to a family member with an underlying health condition. Those that want to leave campus can receive a full refund on their housing and meal plans if they leave by Sunday, Sept. 13.\n\"For those students already taking a fully online course load, this will not be a major change. On the other hand, we know this is disappointing for the many students and their families who had hoped for an on-campus experience,\" Englert and Epps' message read. \"Please know that if the data supported a decision to safely continue the fall semester experience on campus, we would have made every effort to do so. Unfortunately, the risks associated with the Covid-19 pandemic are simply too great for our students, faculty, staff and neighboring community.\"\nTemple was the only large university in the city to bring students back to campus for the fall semester, with both Drexel University and the University of Pennsylvania opting to keep dorms closed and hold the majority of classes virtually.\nTemple started the fall semester last Monday with fewer than 9,000 students attending classes on campus, compared to about 27,000 on the first day of classes last fall. Temple faculty and staff railed against the school's decision to open for in-person instruction, demanding that administrators move fall semester courses online to prevent the spread of Covid-19.\nThe spike in cases at Temple has sparked concern among city officials, who sounded the alarm this week about it potentially driving outbreaks in other parts of the city. At a press conference Tuesday, Philadelphia Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas Farley said there was a \"substantial risk\" of the outbreak infecting nearby communities in North Philadelphia since many students live off-campus. The neighborhoods surrounding Temple are largely home to Black and Hispanic populations, who also face a higher risk of hospitalization and death from Covid-19, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. _ https://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2020/09/03/temple-fall-semester-virtual-covid-outbreak.html _ The Business Journals _ 2020-09-03 | Temple <b>University</b> suspends in-person classes due to <b>COVID-19</b> <b>outbreak</b> _ PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- Temple University is suspending in-person classes for two weeks amid a COVID-19 outbreak.\nThe announcement was made on Sunday in a letter to the university community, citing the increase as a possible result of small social gatherings happening off-campus.\n\"We are instituting a two-week 'pause' for in-person classes, and an extensive collaboration with PDPH to test and contact trace student cases and minimize further spread,\" the university said Sunday, after officials reported nearly 60 active COVID-19 cases within the school community on Friday.\nREAD MORE: 'It's going to be bad': Temple University students, faculty protest in-person classes\nThe university says further tests revealed that there are now a total of 103 active cases.\n\"I don't see a lot of distancing, but we're trying to wear masks,\" said Bella Alba, a sophomore at Temple.\nStudents taking in-person classes will go online starting Monday, August 31, and will continue until September 11.

The university and Philadelphia Health Department conducted hundreds of tests Monday and are advising students to take precautions.\nThis has been happening to universities across the country. They open and there\u2019s a spike in coronavirus cases, forcing a shutdown.\nTemple University announced Sunday it will temporarily stop in-person classes and Monday there were 400 appointments for tests. But they were bombarded with an unexpected number of students who showed up worried about being infected.\nThere was a long line of students at Temple University in North Philadelphia waiting for COVID-19 testing after the university paused in-person classes because of a spike in cases, doubling from 50 on Friday to 100 by Sunday.\n\u201cWe are doing large-scale testing of those students who have been close contacts and those students who\u2019ve called and said I\u2019m not feeling well,\u201d said Temple representative Ray Betzner.\nTwenty-five percent of Temple\u2019s students \u2014 about 9,000 \u2014 chose in-person classes. The hybrid model allowed for both on-campus or remote learning.\nThe fall semester was only a week old when the coronavirus cases on campus spiked.\n\u201cWe were both a little surprised to see the numbers jump so much but what are you going to do? It\u2019s college,\u201d freshman Kylie Hier.\n\u201cIt\u2019s bound to happen that cases go up. It\u2019s a big school, it happens,\u201d freshman Taylor Woolford said.\nContact tracing indicates the students who tested positive live in dorms and off-campus housing. The outbreak does not appear to be related to large parties.\n\u201cThere is some reason to believe that smaller social gatherings, six to eight people, getting together, pizza, beer, watch a game, for example, may be where this uptick in cases is coming from,\u201d Betzner said.\nStudents who test positive are being advised to self-isolate for two weeks.\nThe Philadelphia Health Department is providing additional on-campus testing and helping with contact tracing.\n\u201cSome cases have reported that they may have attended classes when they were ill and so we prioritize the students that we know were close contacts to those cases,\u201d Dr. Angelico Razon said.\nTemple University is now switching to all remote learning for at least two weeks.\n\u201cI\u2019m okay with it, it keeps everybody safe. You gotta do what you gotta do,\u201d freshman Manbeer Grewal said.\nHealth officials are warning students to avoid social gatherings with people outside of their household and to wear masks.\nAs of Sunday, the university had tested more than 5,000 students and 103 were positive.\nThey\u2019ll be testing throughout the week and are expecting to get results within 48 hours.\nThe health department says they hope to have a better understanding of the outbreak and its local impact within the next few days. _ https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2020/08/31/temple-university-moving-to-online-learning-for-at-least-two-weeks-amid-covid-19-outbreak/ _ CBS Philly _ 2020-08-31 | Temple&#39;s <b>COVID-19</b> <b>outbreak</b> could spread beyond <b>university</b>, Philly health commissioner warns _ Thom Carroll/for PhillyVoice\nA COVID-19 outbreak around Temple University's campus in North Philadelphia has the city's health department worried that students living off-campus may transmit the coronavirus to the surrounding community.\nTemple has reported 127 COVID-19 cases since students returned late last month. To curb the spread of the virus, the university paused in-person instruction for a two-week period.\nWhile the majority of active cases at Temple are classified as \"on-campus,\" that does not necessarily mean those with the infection live on campus. It means that they were in a Temple facility at some point during the time they were infectious.\nThe city's health department has been actively involved in expanding testing both on-campus and around the university, Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas Farley said Tuesday.\nOn Sunday, the city conducted tests at an off-campus residential building where there were already three known cases of COVID-19. Among the 38 people tested at that building, 15 had positive results.\nYesterday, the health department tested 396 people on campus. Among them, 60 came back positive \u2014 about 15%.\n\"Overall, these numbers are concerning, and the rate of rise is even more concerning,\" Farley said. \"There clearly is an outbreak occurring among Temple University students.\"\nContact tracing efforts conducted by the city suggest most of the exposure is occurring among students living in off-campus apartments, many of them in shared spaces.\nTemple President Richard Englert said over the weekend that most of the university's cases are asymptomatic or mild infections. But city officials are concerned about the virus affecting vulnerable residents in North Philadelphia and beyond.\nTo manage the outbreak, the health department has updated its guidelines on social gatherings at colleges and universities in Philadelphia. The guidance now clarifies that gatherings of 25 or fewer people should not be considered safe, as some may have assumed based on the city's general limits on gatherings.\n\"You should assume that anyone around you is infected,\" Farley said Tuesday, addressing Temple students. \"Stay in your room or stay in your apartment unless you have to go out for essential errands. Wear a mask when you're around anyone else. Otherwise, this outbreak could grow quickly, and it could threaten the rest of the campus and the rest of the city.\"\nThe health department is now working closely with Temple's administration to develop a longer-term plan for addressing the outbreak as the semester continues.\nPhiladelphia reported 131 new COVID-19 cases Tuesday, bringing the city's total to 33,909 since the start of the pandemic. Another two fatalities brought the city's death toll to 1,751, including 875 nursing home residents.\nDuring the week ending Aug. 29, the city averaged 97 cases per day, with a test positivity rate of about 3.7%.\nFarley noted that the newly reported cases do not include many Temple students who list their home addresses outside Philadelphia. Those cases will be added to the city's count as the university provides up-to-date information, including names and phone numbers of students for the health department to conduct contact tracing.\nStill, among the new cases reported in Philadelphia on Tuesday, 32% were between the ages of 20 and 29.\n\"I think that large percentage does reflect the outbreak that's occurring at Temple,\" Farley said. \u201cThe number of new cases that we\u2019re seeing on Temple\u2019s campus is extremely worrisome.\"\nThe outbreak mirrors similar issues with COVID-19 at college campuses across the region and the United States.\nLock Haven University in Clinton County suspended in-person courses for two weeks on Tuesday in response to increased infections.

While most who have tested positive are asymptomatic, some are experiencing mild flu-like symptoms.\nEnglert said Temple officials believe this outbreak of coronavirus cases stems from small, off-campus social gatherings. As a result, the Philadelphia Department of Public Health was forced to revise its guidance regarding social gatherings among the city's college students this past weekend.\nNo more than 25 people should hang out at indoor gatherings, and no more than 50 people should get together outdoors. Events where students are not wearing face masks or practicing social distancing should not be taking place.\nAs a result of the recent outbreak, the university is urging students to wear face coverings on and off campus, avoid social gatherings of any size, and cancel any travel plans.\nThe university also is collaborating with city health officials to test and contact trace cases. Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms should be tested, and anyone who came in contact with someone who tested positive for the virus should self-quarantine for two weeks.\nTemple remains hopeful it will be able to return to its hybrid learning model for the fall semester, but any decision to move forward will be driven by public health data and guidance.\n\"Since the very first reports of COVID-19 touched our lives, Temple has consistently held one position: We will do the best we can to keep our community healthy and safe, while ensuring our students receive an excellent education and continue progress to graduation,\" Temple University President Richard Englert said.\n\"I want to thank all of our students, faculty and administrative staff members for your cooperation so far. We are counting on your continued diligence as we meet the challenges ahead. Rest assured that we will continue to base our decisions on data and the advice of medical and health professionals. We are in this together, so we can be together.\"\nDining and residence halls will remain open, and student support services will continue operations too.\nTemple's decision to revert to virtual learning for the next two weeks comes just a week after the fall semester began.\nThe Temple Association of University Professionals, the school's faculty union, said that two weeks of online-only instruction is not enough. The group has been among several on campus calling for an all-remote education model this semester.\n\"We need to do everything possible to keep people from falling ill with this terrible virus,\" the organization wrote on Facebook.\nTemple Student Government has called for online-only classes for the entire fall term and all residence halls to close. The organization did not immediately respond for comment on Monday morning. _ https://www.phillyvoice.com/temple-university-in-person-classes-fall-2020-semester-covid-19-cases/ _ PhillyVoice _ 2020-08-31 | Temple <b>University</b> Suspends Most In-Person Classes for Fall Semester After Coronavirus <b>Outbreak</b> _ Temple University is suspending most in-person learning for the fall semester after an COVID-19 infection spike on campus.\nSome two weeks after the start of the fall semester, Temple reported more than 200 novel coronavirus cases. The Philadelphia Department of Health set up a mass testing site on the school's North Philadelphia campus.\nThe spike caused the university to pause in-person learning for two weeks, but by Thursday they decided to extend that ban for the rest of the semester.\n\"Now, in light of the recent increase in positive test results among our students, and after consultation with our own healthcare professionals and leaders at the Philadelphia Department of Public Health, we have concluded that the data indicate it is time to pivot to primarily online education, as we said we would be prepared to do,\" Temple University president Richard Englert said in a statement Thursday morning.\nEssential in-person classes will continue. The university estimates 95% of classes will be delivered online.\nStudents living in on-campus housing can get a full refund of housing and meal plans for the fall semester if they leave by Sunday, Sept. 13, Englert said. Students who need to access university services like computer labs or health services as well as those who have family members with underlying health conditions can stay on campus.\nTemple is one of several major universities around the United States contending with major COVID-19 outbreaks. There have been large outbreaks at Iowa State, the University of Iowa, James Madison University and the University of Notre Dame.\nSpeaking to NBC News on Wednesday, Dr. Anthony Fauci urged schools to keep infected students and those exposed quarantined on campus instead of sending them home.\n\"When you send them home, particularly when you're dealing with a university where people come from multiple different locations, you could be seeding the different places with infection,\" said Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\nThe Black Doctors COVID-19 Consortium, a group focused on testing vulnerable populations that lack adequate access to quality health care, diverted their testing program to Temple to help the city get a scope of the outbreak on campus.\n\"We were scheduled to be at a church in Darby, Pennsylvania yesterday that we had scheduled with Congresswoman [Mary Kay] Scanlon that we had to cancel, but we recognize that the positivity rate on this campus is extremely high,\" Dr. Ala Stanford of the consortium said Wednesday. \"And they\u2019re in the heart of North Philadelphia.\"\nUniversity and city health officials have said they believe small, off-campus social gatherings were fueling the Temple outbreak.\nThis is a developing story.

In this instance, we appear to be seeing new cases that result from small social gatherings happening off campus,\u201d Englert said in a letter to the Temple community. \u201cThis trend prompted conversations with the Philadelphia Department of Public Health (PDPH) and resulted in the revised guidance issued by PDPH on Saturday.\n\u201cThe new data also prompted the university\u2019s leadership to implement the flexibility embedded in the comprehensive plans we developed earlier this year.

According to the Middlesex-London Health Unit (MLHU) the new cases originated with a group of 15 young people including 11 who lived in three different student houses.\nThey came together and mixed with others in bars and at parties over a five-day stretch starting Sept. 8. During these get-togethers, they took part in behaviour that showed little regard for rules in place to curb the spread of the deadly virus.\nAt a news update Thursday, Dr. Chris Mackie, London's medical officer of health, presented a chart that showed how detailed contact tracing linked these individuals and how they came together at various gatherings. The chart shows how the students went out to bars together, met to watch a basketball game and even shared drinks and an e-cigarette.\nOf the 28 Western students now infected, all but one live off-campus. A statement from the university issued Thursday said all students and their close contacts are in isolation, including the student on campus, who lives in residence.\nWestern president Alan Shepard called the outbreak \"very concerning\" at a media update Thursday.\n\"We expect our students to comply with public health rules,\" he said. \"We're asking them not to host parties. Not to attend parties. Limiting social activities to your roommates and significant others will help stop the spread of the virus. Common sense is critical.\"\n'You are going to kill someone'\nLondon Mayor Ed Holder was more scathing, saying he was \"angry and frustrated\" over the outbreak. He implored young people who are \"part of the problem\" to change their behaviour.\n\"If this continues, you are going to kill someone,\" he said. \"Should daily case counts remain this high for a sustained period, community spread is a near certainty, and it's a matter of 'when' not 'if' somebody dies. What an awful burden to carry.\"\nLondon announced 11 new cases of COVID-19 on Thursday; 10 are Western students and one a student at Fanshawe College. The university confirmed those numbers, combined with cases announced over the weekend, mean a total of 28 Western students have now tested positive.\nLondon has had 776 coronavirus cases since January. Of those, 40 remain active, all others are \"resolved.\" A total of 32 cases have been identified in the past five days.\nThe outbreak has prompted Western to halt many non-academic activities on campus, including suspending athletics and recreation activities and in-person student club meetings and events.\nShepard said the university wouldn't hesitate to enforce its code of conduct, which carries punishments that range from reprimand to full expulsion for behaviours that put others at risk. Shepard also, however, conceded that the code's authority is limited when it comes to student behaviour off-campus.\nRisky behaviour\nIn presenting the contact tracing information, Mackie said the cases are linked to risky and unnecessary close contact.\n\"It's gathering in large groups, it's gathering with people from outside of your household or outside of your bubble,\" he said. \"It's unnecessary, very close contact. Things like sharing food, drinks and e-cigarettes, things we know are the highest risk of spreading COVID-19.\"\nA social media campaign aimed at reminding students about COVID-19 rules was launched before students began to arrive around Labour Day Weekend. While most students appear to be following the rules, people have called police after seeing house parties where students weren't distancing or wearing masks.\nThere have not been many incidents of close contact between the students who tested positive and other students on campus, Mackie said.\nOther cases likely\nHowever, Mackie also said that given the incubation period of the virus, it's likely more cases will emerge. So far however, Mackie said there's been no \"spillover\" from the student cases into London's general population.\nThis is the largest spike in cases in the London region since mid-August, a climb that began last week when students returned. On Sunday, the local health unit declared a community outbreak.\nTwo downtown bars popular with the student crowd, Lost Love and El Furniture Warehouse, closed temporarily last week.\nSince cases started to increase this week, Londoners are rushing to get tested. Wait times at London's two assessment centres were not as long Thursday, running about two hours at both the Carling and Oakridge sites, compared to three hours on Wednesday.\nThe health unit has asked people to only get tested if they are symptomatic. The university on Friday set up a testing centre on campus.\nOn Tuesday, the day both centres had to turn people away because they were at capacity, the Carling site reported testing 425 people. The Oakridge facility tested 404.\nMeanwhile, Ontario is reporting 293 cases of COVID-19 on Thursday. In a tweet, Health Minister Christine Elliott said that 70 per cent of the new cases were found in people under 40. _ https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/western-university-students-outbreak-1.5728015 _ CBC.ca _ 2020-09-18 | Everything we know (so far) about Western <b>University</b>&#39;s <b>COVID-19</b> <b>outbreak</b> _ A team of London Free Press journalists is covering the ongoing COVID-19 crisis at Western University, where as of Thursday 28 students had tested positive for the virus and officials have started restricting on-campus activities as London residents grow increasingly concerned.

But, unfortunately, this development means we will be limiting those experiences,\" said Alan Shepard, president of Western.\nThe news comes just days after Western students flooded a testing site upon receiving word that five students had tested positive. The centre reached its capacity within two hours of opening on Monday.\nDays before that, images and videos of people partying \u2014 and tagging Western University \u2014 popped up on social media sites including Instagram and TikTok.\n\"The vast majority of the transmission looks like it happened off campus \u2014 either at house parties or in local bars,\" Shepard said in an interview. \"So there's really no evidence of on-campus transmission.\"\nHe said the school felt it important to send a strong message to students that COVID-19 is serious, so administrators decided to roll back to what they call \"Western Stage 3.\"\nThe school suspended athletics and recreation, as well as in-person club meetings and events. Access to libraries and several other buildings is also restricted, though on-campus classes continue, with about 25 per cent of courses having an in-person component. Residences are also still open.\nDr. David Williams, the province's chief medical officer of health, said he's glad students are getting tested, but there's room for improvement on campus.\n\"We've seen some clusters of cases and individuals who in their ... first number of days back at the campus would seem to have let down their guard a bit and have had some events and activities,\" he said.\nMatt Reesor, president of Western University Students' Council, said that while the outbreak is disappointing, it doesn't reflect the attitude of the student body at large.\n\"Based on my time on campus and throughout my conversations with students, it is clear that most students are abiding by health and safety guidelines and understand that preventing the spread of COVID-19 is a shared responsibility,\" Reesor said in a statement.\nHe said the council is now working with the school and public health officials to get that message across to those who have been ignoring it.\nWestern, like its rival Queen's University in Kingston, Ont., is also warning it will crack down on those who put the health of others at risk.\nThe school noted in a statement that students violating the rules could be referred for review under the student code of conduct.\nIt's a complaint-based process, Shepard noted, and students have the right to defend themselves, so it remains to be seen whether such a review would result in serious consequences.\nBut he said in the most serious cases, students could see complaints brought against them.\n\"Being an educational institution, we're trying to educate people rather than punish them whenever possible,\" Shepard said.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published on Sept. 17, 2020.\nNicole Thompson, The Canadian Press _ https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/world/covid-19-outbreak-prompts-western-university-to-end-non-academic-activities/ar-BB199snB _ The Canadian Press on MSN.com _ 2020-09-17 | UWO lab to test wastewater for evidence of <b>COVID-19</b> _ OSHKOSH, Wis. (WBAY) - In an effort to catch COVID-19 outbreaks before they happen, a lab at the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh will test wastewater from the residence halls starting next week.\nUniversity officials say historically wastewater testing has been a valuable tool for catching the early detection of diseases, which is why the Environmental Research and Innovation Center on campus will soon be collecting and analyzing samples from every residence hall. The lab will process the samples and send them to a private lab for analysis.\n\u201cThe goal of that is to get early detection for any COVID-positive people that maybe asyptomatic, and catch those positive results quickly so targeting testing can be done,\u201d Greg Kleinheinz, UW-Oshkosh Chair of Sustainable Technology, said.\n\u201cMonitoring the dorm wastewater on the U.W.-Oshkosh campus for the presence of COVID-19 will assist university and oshkosh area health officials in public health decision making, as COVID-19 can be shed in the feces of both symptomatic and asymptomatic people,\u201d said ERIC lab manager Carmen Thiel.\nAt least in the beginning, about 10 samples will be taken twice a week.\nRight now, about 2,300 students live on campus.\n\u201cIt\u2019s proven to work pretty well so far. Arizona State, Idaho, Utah State all used it successfully to stop outbreaks on their campuses,\u201d Kleinheinz said. \u201cU.W.-Madison has also started this with the state lab of hygiene. So we think it\u2019s going to be pretty effective.\u201d\nThe testing won\u2019t provide any specific numbers when it comes to individual dorms, but it will let the university know if evidence of the virus is high, low, or non-existent.\nAnd it\u2019s not just the university that\u2019s collecting samples from wastewater as a prevention method. The ERIC lab has already been testing sewage at local health care facilities.\n\u201cOur group is already doing it for a couple health care providers in the Valley, and it\u2019s for the same reason,\" Kleinheinz said, \u201cso if they have a home with a number of individuals, you can test that wastewater and see if there\u2019s people infected. High schools and other places have lots of people in a confined area, it works really well.\u201d\nCopyright 2020 WBAY.

So Jeff Bilzinck is getting a smaller bottle to scoop a little poop, so to speak. Not that you\u2019d be able to tell by looking at it\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s disappointed when it\u2019s not all gross,\u201dBilzinck said.\nBilzinck and his coworker Nick are collecting wastewater from across campus, for this man, So he can test it for COVID-19.\n\u201cHi, I\u2019m Dr. Pepper.\u201d\nNo, not that Dr. Pepper. Dr. Ian Pepper is a different kind of liquid genius.\n\u201cI\u2019m the director of the Water and Energy Sustainable Technology Center,\u201d said Pepper.\nDr. Pepper and his team have been testing wastewater for the coronavirus since students came back to campus and early in the school year, stopped a potential outbreak. After wastewater from a dorm came back positive, school officials tested the students living there and identified two asymptomatic students.\n\u201cThe trick is by identifying the asymptomatic cases early, we are, if not eliminating, we are reducing exponential spread of the virus,\u201d said Pepper.\nWastewater testing is gaining some steam in the scientific community outside of Arizona.\n\u201cWe as individuals, humans, shed these virus in fecal material,\u201d said Kellog Schwab, the director of the Water Institute at Johns Hopkins University.\nHe has been studying wastewater virology for 30 years. He says what they\u2019re doing in Arizona is complicated.\n\u201cIt is not straight forward. There are a lot of interfering substances as you can imagine in a waste stream that you have to then purify the virus from. It\u2019s not just you grab a sample from a particular part of the environment and then instantly be able to detect the virus. You need to process that sample, you need to maintain the integrity of your target of interest, and then you have to have the appropriate detection,\u201d said Schwab.\nBut he and Dr. Pepper agree that this type of testing could be scaled up and implemented at universities and other populated facilities where COVID-19 could potentially spread.\n\u201cWastewater epidemiology has the potential to be scalable,\u201d said Schwab.\n\u201cPerhaps targeting high-risk areas like nursing homes. We\u2019re helping people in Yuma, Arizona, testing our farm workers when they come here in the fall, so there\u2019s a great deal of potential,\u201d said Pepper.\n\u201cMany research laboratories have the capacity to do this,\u201d said Schwab.\nThat potential to expand this type of testing, and keep people safe, keeps Pepper going.\n\u201cWe are keeping the university open, which is really important. And, you know, dare I say, actually, probably saving lives,\u201d said Pepper.\nSaving lives and closing the lid on the coronavirus. _ https://www.wtvr.com/news/national/coronavirus/wastewater-testing-program-prevents-massive-covid-19-outbreak-at-the-university-of-arizona _ WTVR _ 2020-09-11 | <b>University</b> of Arizona Stops a <b>Covid-19</b> <b>Outbreak</b> by Following the Feces _ The University of Arizona managed to nip an outbreak of Covid-19 in the bud by monitoring its students\u2019 poop, report Paulina Pineda and Rachel Leingang for the Arizona Republic.\nSome people infected with the novel coronavirus shed fragments of its genetic material in their feces, which can then be detected in wastewater even if they\u2019re asymptomatic. This method can offer health officials an early warning because the virus may show up in sewage days before infected people show symptoms and submit themselves for testing. This monitoring technique has been used by cities and even national parks across the country and the world.\nAt the University of Arizona (UA), researchers were collecting samples of sewage from 20 buildings on campus as part of the school\u2019s testing regimen as roughly 5,000 students returned to campus for the 2020-2021 academic year, reports Jaclyn Peiser for the Washington Post.\nThis week, the technique detected coronavirus genetic material in the Likins dorm\u2019s wastewater. On Wednesday the school tested all 311 people associated with the dorm. Those tests revealed two students who were experiencing asymptomatic infections, and UA swiftly quarantined them, per the Post.\n\u201cWe in fact found cases that no one would have known about and now we\u2019re contact tracing all of their contacts to find out how many other students may be positive and asymptomatic,\u201d says Robert Robbins, the school\u2019s president, in a news briefing.\nTesting on campus had turned up 47 positive coronavirus tests as of Thursday morning, reports Christopher Conover for Arizona Public Media.\nOther colleges monitoring their wastewater as they attempt to resume instruction in what is sure to be a highly unusual academic year include the University of California at San Diego and Syracuse University, according to the Post.\n\"Testing the wastewater gives you an idea of the number of cases within a community and if the numbers are increasing or decreasing,\" says Ian Pepper, director of UA\u2019s Water and Energy Sustainable Technology Center which is conducting wastewater surveillance on campus, in a statement. \"The approach can also be used to help determine if an intervention is working to reduce the transmission of the virus.\"\nUA is also using an exposure notification app called COVID Watch, reports Shaq Davis for Tucson.com. The app, which has roughly 11,000 users, detects nearby devices via bluetooth and will send out a notification to anyone who has come in close contact with someone who later reports themselves as infected.\nOther campuses, including Notre Dame, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Michigan State University, have experienced large enough spikes in cases that they were forced to switch to online only classes, according to the Post.\nThis instance of using wastewater to detect a nascent outbreak before it spread widely shows the promise of this monitoring technique, says Richard Carmona, a former U.S. Surgeon General who is guiding UA\u2019s reopening, in a press conference.\n\u201cNobody would have known that otherwise, but with that early detection, we jumped on it right away, tested those youngsters and got them the appropriate isolation where they needed to be,\u201d says Carmona. \u201cAnd you think about if we had missed it, if we had waited until they became symptomatic, and they stayed in that dorm for days, or a week or the whole incubation period, how many other people would have been infected?\u201d _ https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/university-arizona-stops-covid-19-outbreak-following-feces-180975684/ _ Smithsonian Magazine _ 2020-08-31 | Predicting A <b>Covid-19</b> <b>Outbreak</b> With Wastewater Analysis _ Early in the Covid-19 pandemic, research showed that people infected with the novel coronavirus shed viral material in their feces. This has led to interest in what is sometimes called \u201csewage epidemiology\u201d by public health officials.\nRoutine wastewater surveillance can be used as a vital early warning tool to alert communities to new coronavirus infections. This is because sewage or wastewater that goes through the drainage system to a treatment facility can indicate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in an area before the virus would normally be detected by way of individual PCR tests.\nThe Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) has outlined plans to map the outbreak of coronavirus across the Netherlands, using wastewater analysis. For this purpose, RIVM will be expanding the number of measuring points at water treatment plants from 80 to 300.\nThe RIVM wants to be able to establish not only that there are virus particles in the wastewater, but also approximately how many households those particles originate from. The agency has begun publishing the test results - number of virus particles in a milliter of wastewater - on the country\u2019s coronavirus dashboard.\nIn late March, right after the peak in coronavirus transmissions, the RIVM began reporting wastewater measurement. The figure below shows that virus particles in wastewater fell sharply from the end of March through May, plateaued at a low level in June and the first part of July, rose in late July through mid August, and then began decreasing again.\nMeasurement of SARS-CoV-2 Particles in Dutch Wastewater\nPublic health officials don\u2019t regard wastewater testing as a replacement of regular testing, rather as complementary to it. By itself, conventional PCR testing of individuals isn\u2019t sufficient. This is due in part to the fact that many people are asymptomatic, and so they\u2019re much less likely to get tested. And even when some people have possible symptoms of Covid-19 they may not be willing to get tested.\nWastewater testing offers a predictor map of the outbreak in a particular region that doesn\u2019t rely on individuals\u2019 willingness to get tested. Similarly, prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, efforts in sewage monitoring in a number of countries enabled detection of outbreaks of norovirus, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, polio, and measles.\nWastewater testing isn\u2019t just something being done in the Netherlands. Tests at wastewater treatment plants in France have revealed levels of coronavirus that rose preceding an increase in confirmed clinical cases. In Israel, public health authorities regularly screen sewage and waste, as part of an early warning system. And, in the city of Ashkelon, researchers at Ben-Gurion University have been attempting to estimate the number of virus particles that patients shed. In the U.K., a network of scientists have collaborated with local water companies to collect samples of untreated sewage from treatment plants for testing.\nIn the U.S., municipalities in several states, including Colorado, Ohio, and New York, have taken steps toward implementing systematic wastewater surveillance efforts. On Thursday, September 3rd, Ohio\u2019s Governor DeWine touted his state\u2019s Coronavirus Wastewater Monitoring Network, a new effort to study wastewater at a number of sewage treatment plants to help contain the spread of coronavirus.\nAnd, this summer at the University of Arizona scientists and staff set up a system to test wastewater across campus. At the end of August, using wastewater testing, school authorities were able to discover the presence of coronavirus in a particular dorm on campus. In turn, this triggered testing of individuals in the dorm, and isolation of two who tested positive. This possibly prevented a larger outbreak from happening.\nThe University of Arizona example illustrates how wastewater testing in conjunction with follow-up testing with rapid results can halt a campus-wide outbreak in its tracks.\nWastewater surveillance appears to be expanding to other places of higher education in the U.S. The Rochester Institute of Technology in New York is currently testing wastewater for coronavirus. And, the University of North Carolina at Charlotte is planning to deploy wastewater analysis at its dorms once students arrive there later this month.\nSewage sampling provides a relatively inexpensive, yet comprehensive overview of the actual viral load in a community, a week or two earlier than existing PCR tests done on individuals. But, the U.S. lacks comprehensive state and local efforts in this area, let alone a national coronavirus wastewater testing program.\nA national wastewater surveillance program could offer a potentially cost-effective approach to track coronavirus across the U.S. population and provide early warning of an initial outbreak or a recurrence of the virus. _ https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2020/09/01/predicting-a-covid-19-outbreak-with-wastewater-analysis/ _ Forbes _ 2020-09-01 | The <b>University</b> of Arizona says it caught a dorm\u2019s <b>covid-19</b> <b>outbreak</b> before it started. Its secret weapon: Poop. _ As 5,000 students prepared for move-in day at the University of Arizona this week, the school warned they would be tested periodically for the coronavirus. One test, though, doesn\u2019t involve a nose swab. The university is regularly screening the sewage from each dorm, searching for traces of the virus.\nOn Thursday, officials said the technique worked \u2014 and possibly prevented a sizable outbreak on campus. When a wastewater sample from one dorm came back positive this week, the school quickly tested all 311 people who live and work there and found two asymptomatic students who tested positive. They were quickly quarantined.\n\u201cWith this early detection, we jumped on it right away, tested those youngsters, and got them the appropriate isolation where they needed to be,\u201d said Richard Carmona, a former U.S. surgeon general who is directing the school\u2019s reentry task force, in a news conference.\nResearchers around the world have been studying whether wastewater testing can effectively catch cases early to prevent covid-19 clusters. There are programs in Singapore, China, Spain, Canada and New Zealand, while in the United States, more than 170 wastewater facilities across 37 states are being tested. Earlier this month, officials in Britain announced testing at 44 water treatment facilities. The Netherlands has been collecting samples at 300 sewage treatment plants.\nWith colleges battling large outbreaks around the country, the University of Arizona \u2014 which is trying a mix of online and in-person courses \u2014 elected to test sewage from all 20 residence halls. Other schools are doing the same, including the University of California at San Diego and Syracuse University.\nOn Tuesday at the University of Arizona, that screening process found signs of the virus in the wastewater from a dorm called Likins Hall. Although all students living in the dorm had to pass antigen tests before moving in, the second screening after the wastewater alert found the two positive cases.\nCarmona said without the sewage testing, those two asymptomatic students could have spread the virus far before it was detected.\n\u201cYou think about if we had missed it, if we had waited until they became symptomatic and they stayed in that dorm for days, or a week, or the whole incubation period, how many other people would have been infected?\u201d he said.\nWastewater testing has been used for years to test for other viruses, to study illicit drug use and to understand the socioeconomic status of a community based on its food consumption, according to Kevin Thomas, director of the University of Queensland\u2019s Alliance for Environmental Health Sciences. Thomas has been working with a federal research agency to develop techniques on how to best detect traces of the virus in Australia. Wastewater testing is effective because fragments of the virus stay in feces, he said.\n\u201cI really do think it\u2019s a good demonstration of the technique and technology because all the researchers working in this space internationally have come to the conclusion that is a very good early warning system,\u201d Thomas said of Arizona\u2019s experience in an interview with The Washington Post.\nThe process used to test the effluent is the same as those used for nose swab tests, which involves \u201cconcentrating the fragments within the sample and then extracting the RNA,\u201d Thomas said.\nAt the University of Arizona, the procedure can also study whether the university\u2019s efforts to curb infection rates have been effective, said Ian Pepper, director of the University of Arizona\u2019s Water and Energy Sustainable Technology Center, in a news release.\n\u201cThe approach can also be used to help determine if an intervention is working to reduce the transmission of the virus,\u201d he said.\nAs of Thursday, the university has had 46 positives amid more than 10,000 antigen tests. But students have been on campus for only a week. New cases in Arizona have fallen 25 percent this past week, according to The Post\u2019s coronavirus case tracker. There have been more than 200,000 cases and almost 5,000 deaths in the state since the end of February.\nUniversity of Arizona President Robert C. Robbins said that numbers will go up on campus. \u201cIt\u2019s inevitable,\u201d he said in the news conference. \u201cThe issue is going to be can we handle the steady flow of cases or do we get a big spike in cases that overwhelms our ability to isolate and continue to test.\u201d\nThat scenario has already played out at a number of schools, including Notre Dame, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Michigan State University, forcing them to switch to online classes only. At the University of Alabama, where 530 cases were detected the first week, school officials suspended students who violated social distancing rules by attending parties.\nThomas said that as some colleges bring students back on campus, testing wastewater from dorms could be an effective technique \u2014 along with individual testing and contact tracing \u2014 to manage the spread of the virus.\n\u201cThe proof is there that it works, and it does seem to be a very sensitive approach,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a proactive way of trying to manage the potential for infection on campus.\u201d _ https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/08/28/arizona-coronavirus-wastewater-testing/ _ Washington Post _ 2020-08-30 | <b>University</b> of Arizona screening for <b>COVID-19</b> via dorms\u2019 raw sewage _ Enlarge Image\nIt\u2019s in the poop.\nThe University of Arizona is studying the feces in its sewer system to test for COVID-19, and it might have already stopped a possible outbreak.\nResearchers found in May that studying human feces in sewer systems worldwide could be the secret to curbing a second wave of COVID-19 until widespread testing is available.\nThe university is preparing for a variety of periodic tests to help curb the coronavirus \u2014 including one that involves screening raw sewage from the dorms to see if it is found in students\u2019 poop.\nSchool officials told The Washington Post that the technique has already been in use during move-in week for its 5,000 students and it might have already stopped a big outbreak on the campus after a sewage sample came back positive from one dorm. All students were quickly tested individually and two asymptomatic students tested positive and were quickly quarantined.\n\u201cWith this early detection, we jumped on it right away, tested those youngsters, and got them the appropriate isolation where they needed to be,\u201d said Richard Carmona, a former US surgeon general who is directing the school\u2019s reentry task force, according to the paper.\nCarmona lauded the university\u2019s system.\n\u201cYou think about if we had missed it, if we had waited until they became symptomatic and they stayed in that dorm for days or a week, or the whole incubation period, how many other people would have been infected?\u201d he said.\n\u201cI really do think [the University of Arizona is] a good demonstration of the technique and technology because all the researchers working in this space internationally have come to the conclusion that is a very good early warning system,\u201d Kevin Thomas, director of the University of Queensland\u2019s Alliance for Environmental Health Sciences told The Washington Post.\nSince the outbreak, it has been found that COVID-19 can be spread through \u201caerosolized feces,\u201d and farts, and has the ability to waft through toilets into other apartments. _ https://nypost.com/2020/08/29/university-of-arizona-is-screening-for-covid-19-via-dorms-poop/ _ New York Post _ 2020-08-29 | "}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-112.0758, 33.44825]}, "properties": {"weight": 7.295836866004329, "name": "Arizona State University", "descriptions": "&#39;This is a long-haul thing&#39;: ASU, UA discuss <b>COVID-19</b> campus <b>outbreaks</b>, brace for possible spike _ Both Arizona State <b>University</b> and <b>University</b> of Arizona held virtual meetings Wednesday morning to discuss <b>COVID-19</b> <b>outbreaks</b> among their students and staff in addition to detailing the efforts ... _ https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-education/2020/09/09/asu-uarizona-discuss-covid-19-campus-outbreaks-brace-spike-cases/5757894002/ _ MSN _ 2020-09-10 | &#39;This is a long-haul thing&#39;: ASU, UA discuss <b>COVID-19</b> campus <b>outbreaks</b>, brace for possible spike _ Both Arizona State <b>University</b> and <b>University</b> of Arizona held virtual meetings Wednesday morning to discuss <b>COVID-19</b> <b>outbreaks</b> among their students and staff in addition to detailing the efforts ... _ https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/this-is-a-long-haul-thing-asu-ua-discuss-covid-19-campus-outbreaks-brace-for-possible-spike/ar-BB18Soue _ MSN _ 2020-09-10 | "}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-78.87429, 38.441]}, "properties": {"weight": 7.295836866004329, "name": "James Madison University", "descriptions": "&#39;Astonishingly risky&#39;: <b>COVID-19</b> cases at colleges are fueling the nation&#39;s hottest <b>outbreaks</b> _ At James Madison <b>University</b>, where rising infections have put the independent city of Harrisonburg at the top of the nation&#39;s <b>outbreaks</b>, the college recorded more than 700 <b>COVID-19</b> cases in one ... _ https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2020/09/11/covid-cases-college-us-outbreak-rate-tracker/5759088002/ _ Columbus Dispatch _ 2020-09-11 | Colleges with <b>Covid-19</b> <b>Outbreaks</b> are Sending Students Home _ 1.

All of the infected students are in isolation and being supported, and their contacts are being quarantined to prevent additional spread. Importantly, we do not believe the new infections have spread outside the student community,\u201d the Cornell officials said.\nBut the Cornell leaders emphasized that \u201call is not well\u201d and blasted students for reckless behavior during the pandemic.\n\u201cThis episode demonstrates exactly what President [Martha] Pollack said in her message last night: that there is the potential for just a few small student gatherings to destroy all our plans for an in-person semester,\u201d they said.\n\u201cAlthough we are currently still in a manageable situation, the rapid growth of cases in these recent clusters puts us perilously close to needing to take drastic action, such as moving to wholly online classes for a period of time.\u201d\nIn the letter, the officials said Cornell has suspended and banned students who engaged in \u201cirresponsible behavior and disregard for others in our community.\u201d\n\u201cAll of us share a responsibility to conduct ourselves in ways that do not put others at risk, and we cannot allow the actions of a few to ruin the possibility of an in-person semester and risk the health and safety of our community,\u201d they said.\nOne Cornell professor said the outbreak on campus was troubling.\n\u201cCornell is a well-resourced Ivy League institution with all the protocols, testing and contact tracing in place. What does this mean for our public schools?,\u201d the instructor told The Post.\nBased on outbreaks at colleges, Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Monday predicted that some K-12 schools will have to close buildings and switch totally to online classes. He called outbreaks among college students \u201cthe canary in the coal mine,\u201d adding, \u201cI think it is going to be replicated in K-12.\u201d\nMayor Bill de Blasio has delayed the opening of New York City schools until Sept. 21 amid a tug-of-war with the unions on whether there should be in-person instruction. _ https://nypost.com/2020/09/04/cornell-university-reports-covid-19-cluster-of-nearly-40-cases/ _ New York Post _ 2020-09-04 | "}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-73.8241, 42.689840000000004]}, "properties": {"weight": 6.079441541679836, "name": "State University of New York Albany", "descriptions": "SUNY Albany reports \u2018very concerning\u2019 <b>COVID-19</b> <b>outbreak</b> _ Not addressing the <b>outbreak</b> immediately \u201ccould result ... classes after more than 300 students were infected with <b>COVID-19</b>.

After peaking in July at around 66,000 cases per day, the infection rate began to decline near the end of the month and throughout much of August, but on August 23rd, the rate plateaued, and it just so happens that K-12 schools, colleges, and universities all began to reopen around that time.\nWe\u2019ve seen outbreaks all over the country, from New York to Iowa to Alabama to California, and you probably won\u2019t be surprised to learn that the parts of the country that are seeing the most significant surges in new cases are mostly college towns. In fact, as Best Life points out, 9 of the 10 cities that are experiencing the worst outbreaks in America have colleges or universities that have reopened and welcomed students back to campus.\nThe New York Times has been keeping track of the metro areas with the greatest number of positive cases relative to their population for quite some time, but the updated list shows just how disastrous school reopenings have been. Of the top 10 metro areas, these 9 are all home to colleges or universities that have reopened:\nAuburn-Opelika, Alabama\nAuburn University is one of two major public universities in the state of Alabama, and according to the latest data, it is experiencing the second-worst outbreak in the United States with 7.7 per 1,000 people testing positive in the metro area surrounding the school.\nStatesboro, Georgia\nGeorgia Southern University makes up a significant portion of the population of Statesboro, and over the last two weeks, 710 have tested positive for COVID-19, which puts the area\u2019s rate just under Auburn\u2019s at 7.4 per 1,000.\nAmes, Iowa\nIowa actually appears on the list twice, with Ames \u2014 the home of Iowa State University \u2014 outpacing its neighbor to the east by a hair with 1,143 cases in the last two weeks, tying Statesboro, Georgia with a novel coronavirus infection rate of 7.4 per 1,000.\nIowa City, Iowa\nIowa City, the home of the University of Iowa, had significantly more cases over the past two weeks (1,919) than Ames, but with a much larger population, its rate is slightly lower at 7.2 per 1,000 people.\nPullman, Washington\nWashington state was the epicenter of the pandemic before cases started popping up around the country, but that didn\u2019t stop Washington State University from reopening, and now Pullman has seen 485 new cases over the last two weeks, which is a rate of 6.3 per 1,000.\nOxford, Mississippi\nMississippi has been making headlines for months as the state has been designing a new flag to replace the one that incorporated the Confederate battle flag. They will vote on a new flag in November. That\u2019s encouraging news, but the bad news is that Oxford, Mississippi, which is where the University of Mississippi is located, has reported 422 COVID-19 cases in the last two weeks, good for a rate of 5.2 per 1,000.\nBloomington, Illinois\nBloomington, Illinois has been climbing up the list in recent days, reaching the eighth spot 1,197 cases over the last two weeks for a rate of 4.4 per 1,000 as Illinois State University pledges to stay open.\nPine Bluff, Arkansas\nSomehow, the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, with a student population of less than 2,600, has helped rocket the city of Pine Bluff, Arkansas into the top ten worst outbreaks in America, with 621 positive tests over the last two weeks, which brings the infection rate to 4.3 per 1,000.\nGreenville, North Carolina\nThe 28,000+ Pirates of East Carolina University have dragged Greenville, North Carolina into the top ten, with 1,317 new infections over the last two weeks, which is an infection rate of 4.1 per 1,000.\nAlthough we only covered the top ten metro areas, the New York Times list shows the twenty worst outbreaks in the US, and several more are in other big college towns, including Stillwater, Oklahoma, and Grand Forks, North Dakota. Whether or not we needed any more evidence that it was virtually impossible to reopen schools without causing new outbreaks, we now have it, and the trend will likely continue in the weeks ahead.\nJacob started covering video games and technology in college as a hobby, but it quickly became clear to him that this was what he wanted to do for a living.

Boyce said he and a group of university leaders met Friday with the state\u2019s top health officials for guidance on the isolation and quarantine process.\n\u201cThanks to our robust contact tracing efforts through our team of expert volunteers from the School of Applied Sciences, we have discerned that spread of the virus on our campus is not prevalent in classrooms and academic spaces,\u201d Boyce said in the statement. \u201cWe have linked a number of cases and outbreaks to a failure to follow the protocols in other settings, primarily off-campus social gatherings.\u201d\nBoyce urged students and staff to adhere to social distancing guidelines while on and off campus. _ https://www.wapt.com/article/ole-miss-reports-290-covid-19-cases-on-campus/33865051 _ WAPT _ 2020-09-01 | "}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-105.00232, 39.74644]}, "properties": {"weight": 8.158883083359672, "name": "University of Colorado", "descriptions": "New coronavirus <b>outbreaks</b> reported at schools, a sorority, restaurants and more _ Larger <b>outbreaks</b> have been associated at Colorado colleges and universities.

The outbreak of positive cases was first reported by the Boston Globe's Bob Hohler, whose source told him that the number of cases were thirteen. BC Bulletin reached out to Boston College for confirmation on that number, but the school could not confirm.\nHowever, senior associate athletics director for communications Jason Baum released the following statement:\n\"We can confirm that members of our swimming and diving team have tested positive for COVID-19. \u201cWe have temporarily paused all team activities with the swimming and diving program. The student-athletes who tested positive are in isolation in accordance with university COVID-19 protocols.\u201d\nThe school have been using selected off campus housing as isolation areas for student's who test positive.\nThis news comes shortly after students returned on campus to start the fall semester. It also comes on the heels of the football team having yet another round of COVID-19 testing without a positive. Per the last statement from the school, the football team and their staff have had over 1700 tests done, with only one positive. That student who tested positive has made a full recovery and has rejoined the team.\nWhile last week the men's soccer team cancelled their fall season, due to the team struggling to get players back on campus due to travel restrictions caused by the pandemic.\nYou can follow us for future coverage by clicking \"Follow\" on the top righthand corner of the page.

By contrast, the University had 22 positive cases on September 8, and 21 cases on September 9, an increase, UHS officials said, that was attributable to several off-campus gatherings where students did not wear masks or practice physical distancing.\nUniversity Health Services expects to have conducted more that 4,000 tests by the end of today. They will report weekly and cumulative totals tomorrow via the Reopening Boston College website bc.edu/reopen.\nThe University increased its testing capacity this week, in light of last week\u2019s increase in positive cases. Since testing began on August 16, the University has had a total of 122 positive tests, including 120 undergrads. By contrast, Boston University has reported 102 positive cases, Providence College 107, Northeastern University 54, and University of Notre Dame 675.\nCurrently, there are 85 BC undergraduates in isolation--34 in isolation housing at the Hotel Boston in Brighton, and 51 recovering at home. Thirty-five undergraduates have recovered and returned to normal activities. University administrators say that they have ample space for contact and isolation purposes, and can access beds at Pine Manor College.\n\u201cLast week\u2019s spike in cases was concerning to all of us,\u201d said Director of University Health Services Dr. Douglas Comeau. \u201cBut the numbers have steadily decreased each day since, and we believe that downward trend will continue as a result of extensive contact tracing efforts.\u201d\nComeau said that Boston College is working closely in its contact tracing with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts\u2019 Contact Tracing Collaborative (CTC) and the departments of health in Boston, Newton, and Brookline. The Boston Globe had erroneously reported on September 15 that the state was \u201ctaking over\u201d BC\u2019s contact tracing efforts, but issued a correction later that day. Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker called University President William P. Leahy, S.J., to clarify that he wanted BC to work collaboratively with the CTC, in light of BC\u2019s connections to the three communities of Boston, Newton and Brookline.\nThe University continues to conduct contact tracing along with these entities. As of September 14, 74 of the 104 positive cases on campus were identified through the University\u2019s contact tracing efforts.\nUniversity Health Services, working with Information Technology Services, said that it would restate weekly undergraduate test totals on the Reopening BC website today to be consistent with The Broad Institute data collection process. The restated undergraduate test numbers do not affect cumulative totals that have been provided or the overall positivity rate.\nUHS also announced that it would increase its asymptomatic testing, beginning next week, to Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays throughout the semester, all in the MAC Courts in the Margot Connell Recreation Center, in addition to its daily symptomatic testing conducted through University Health Services and The Broad Institute. The University expects to conduct more than 5,000 tests in the coming week.\nUniversity Communications / September 2020 _ https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/bcnews/campus-community/announcements/covid-19-testing-update.html _ Boston College _ 2020-09-18 | "}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [114.26666999999999, 30.58333]}, "properties": {"weight": 7.295836866004329, "name": "Huazhong Agricultural University", "descriptions": "More cats may have <b>COVID-19</b> than believed: Study _ Researchers from Huazhong Agricultural <b>University</b> took blood samples from 102 cats between January and March 2020, following the first <b>outbreak</b>.

The university will be doing a mix of in-person and online classes to begin the fall semester.\nAs part of the school\u2019s efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19, it said it would test the sewage water from all 20 on-campus student residences.\nOther colleges like the University of California at San Diego and Syracuse University are doing the same.\nOn Tuesday, heath experts at the university found signs of the virus in wastewater from Likins Hall, one of the on-campus dorms.\nAll students living in the dorm were required to pass antigen tests before they were allowed to move in.\nBut it was after coronavirus traces turned up in the feces from the dorm that the two asymptomatic positive cases were discovered.\nAccording to Carmona, without the sewage testing, the two students could have spread the virus without knowing it.\n\u2018You think about if we had missed it, if we had waited until they became symptomatic and they stayed in that dorm for days, or a week, or the whole incubation period, how many other people would have been infected?\u2019 he said.\nArizona was a national hotspot in late June and early July.\nBut it has since become a relative success story after cities and counties implemented mask measures and Governor Doug Ducey ordered bars, nightclubs and gyms to close.\nCan coronavirus be spread by feces?\nA study published in May 2020 in the Lancet found virus particles were present in feces of COVID-19 patients nearly 5 weeks after the patients tested negative.\nThese particles were still viable and could cause fecal-oral transmission of the coronavirus, the Chinese researchers warned.\nFecal\u2013oral transmission has previously been seen in people with SARS and MERS.\nResearchers say routine stool sample testing, as well as the existing throat swabs. should be used to make sure a person is clear of the virus.\nScientists also call for strict precautions to prevent transmission from the virus found in feces.\nA new study shows the toilet lid should be put down before flushing to ensure infectious particles do not drift around the bathroom or cubicle.\nTurbulence from the cascading water designed to remove fecal waste creates vortices which can carry infection droplets from stools up to 3 ft above the water level.\nUp to 60 per cent of the ejected particles rise high above the rim and they can remain airborne for more than a minute.\nThe state Department of Health Services reported just 32 new cases on Thursday, the lowest total since May.\nThat brings the state pandemic total to 200,658.\nArizona reported just 33 new deaths on Thursday, bringing the overall toll to 4,932.\nThe university says it has detected 46 positive cases after administering antigen tests to more than 10,000 students.\nRobert C. Robbins, the university president, expects COVID-19 cases to climb.\n\u2018It\u2019s inevitable,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018The issue is going to be can we handle the steady flow of cases or do we get a big spike in cases that overwhelms our ability to isolate and continue to test.\u2019\nLast week, Notre Dame and Michigan State universities became the latest colleges to move classes online because of the coronavirus as colleges struggle to contain outbreaks and students continue to congregate in large groups without masks or social distancing.\nThe decisions came the same day a third school in the 17-member University of North Carolina system - UNC at Chapel Hill - reported a COVID-19 cluster in off-campus housing.\nThe University of Oklahoma is requiring its sororities to recruit new members virtually after learning of students attending large social events without taking precautions against the virus.\nStudents at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville could face punishments as stiff as expulsion if they host big parties, if they won\u2019t cooperate with COVID-19 contact tracing or if they don\u2019t complete forms documenting their self-isolation, Chancellor Donde Plowman said in a video conference Tuesday.\nHealth experts in several countries, including the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, and Australia, have turned to lab-testing of feces samples in hopes of preventing outbreaks of COVID-19.\nScientists believe nationwide monitoring of sewage systems could be a good way to identify future disease hotspots before they manifest in infection numbers.\nThis could act as an early-warning system to prevent the need for local lockdowns.\nRead more _ https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/university-says-it-prevented-covid-outbreak-by-testing-students-feces/ar-BB18tzPn _ MSN _ 2020-08-28 | <b>Outbreaks</b> of <b>COVID-19</b> were almost guaranteed on <b>school</b> campuses \u2014 here&#39;s what scientists say colleges should do _ Sean Rayford/Getty Images\nColleges across the nation are reopening their campuses, despite those campuses being \"perfect places for disease to spread.\"\nRyan Malosh and Nina Masters, epidemiology researchers at the University of Michigan, attribute the surge in COVID-19 cases among students to universities opting for in-person or hybrid fall semesters.\nMalosh and Masters say putting the blame on students \"isn't fair,\" and that colleges should acknowledge other high contact alternatives \u2014 such as jobs in the surrounding communities \u2014 that could lead to infection.\nUniversal testing and at-home antigen tests, while helpful, aren't a realistic options for schools right now. Instead, they need to focus on safely sending students back home without spreading the virus to their home communities.\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\nScientists have learned a few things over the past six months as the COVID-19 pandemic has continued. We've learned that the virus that causes COVID-19 transmits particularly well when a group of people are together in a small, poorly ventilated area. We've learned that young people are just as susceptible as older people to infection. We've learned that if there is widespread community transmission, the virus will find its way to the very places we don't want it go.\nSo, it's not surprising to us, researchers who study diseases that can be prevented by vaccines, that with schools and colleges reopening, the virus is spreading.\nThese are places designed around the idea of bringing lots of people to one place. Many of them bring people together from all over the world. They are perfect places for disease to spread.\nHow we got here\nBack in March, colleges and universities closed down like everything else except essential businesses. They sent students home. There was a rough transition to online instruction. Students weren't happy, faculty weren't happy. And so, they started to come up with plans on how to reopen for in-person instruction for the fall semester.\nMany places installed plexi-glass barriers in classrooms, considered mask mandates, and worked out physical distancing in lecture halls. Most people realized that professors who taught large classes should plan for remote learning.\nUniversity administrators and public health experts started making these plans in the spring. Back then, we scientists and public health researchers all operated under the assumption that community spread would be under some sort of control by fall. We all thought that the country would increase testing capacity, and we have. Then, once new cases dropped to a low level, we could institute contact tracing, the way other countries had.\nBut that part hasn't happened. And so now these same colleges and universities are facing huge increases in cases, including at the University of North Carolina, Notre Dame, and the University of Alabama. Many universities that have opted to return to in-person classes are also having a surge in cases. These outbreaks will inevitably spread to the wider communities in which the campuses are located.\nIt seems that for many of these institutions, the priority was on financial concerns, which involved a return to a normal fall semester to the greatest extent possible. They then developed plans that they thought would make this possible. Faculty at many institutions and at least one ethics committee have argued that the priority should have been the safety of students, faculty, and the surrounding communities.\nWhile schools across the country have different priorities, enrollments, campus size, and student demographics, many schools share one thing in common: making no real contingency plans around reopening amid COVID-19, other than going remote if governors mandated it.\nThe schools that did spend the summer figuring out how to deliver high quality education remotely, or how to safely provide housing and access to services for the most vulnerable students, are less likely to have their fall semester disrupted. However, the College Crisis Initiative's data dashboard found that only 7% of 1,442 four-year schools surveyed were planning on a fully online fall semester.\nThe challenge ahead\nAnd so, the inevitable has come to pass. Now, many college campuses will struggle to control their outbreaks, because there are a lot of unique challenges inherent to COVID-19 in this population.\nColleges are not nursing homes or prisons. Some are trying to limit contact with the broader community.\nBut in general, students are not kept under lock and key. They have visitors from other schools. They go back and forth to their parents' homes. And, yes, they go to parties. To us, blaming students for wanting a normal-ish college experience when the schools themselves have set the tone for trying hard to return to normal isn't fair.\nIt's also true that not all of the contact students have is as irresponsible as some have suggested. Many students hold jobs in the communities that surround the school. And most of these jobs aren't typically the work-from-home type of job. In our undergraduate careers we both worked at jobs that had high contact rates with the community. And often, when your job is waiting tables at a local pizza place or manning a library desk, most of your colleagues are students as well. All of these factors will make contact tracing very hard.\nPublic health experts also expect a relatively high proportion of college-aged students to be either completely asymptomatic or to only have very mild symptoms. Without universal testing, these students won't know they're sick. They may not isolate if they have mild symptoms. But they will still be able to spread the virus to others. Symptom and temperature screenings may not recognize these individuals as those who need to stay away from campus buildings.\nA different kind of campus test\nWhich brings us to testing. Some places are doing universal testing of students, multiple times per week. But, given the state of testing in the US, that is not a realistic possibility for most schools.\nLet's look at our university as an example. The University of Michigan has an undergraduate population of 30,000 students. Let's assume that two-thirds of them came back to campus. That means 40,000 tests per week just for University of Michigan undergraduate students. Right now the entire state of Michigan is doing a little more than 200,000 diagnostic tests per week. Some schools have developed their own tests to handle this huge increase in capacity. But many university labs are involved in testing for large health systems and the rest of the state too. In these places it becomes very difficult for one in five tests available in an entire state to be dedicated to the students at a single university.\nA scale-up of rapid, at-home antigen tests could be one approach to make testing on this scale feasible. These types of tests have the advantage of detecting highly infectious individuals \u2014 making them a good screening tool \u2014 but many are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration because they aren't as sensitive as the standard PCR-based diagnostic test.\nIf transmission on campus continues to happen mostly outside of the classroom, simply going remote will not solve the problem. Keeping students on campus will be risky. Many students will be attempting to navigate social distancing guidelines without a traditional social support network.\nAs much as possible, we believe students need to be able to safely return to their homes. But this can't be done haphazardly. Bringing them to campus was a predictable risk \u2014 so is sending them home. As colleges inevitably move back to online instruction, plans must be put in place to minimize the risk of seeding epidemics. Dismissing all students, some of whom are infectious, back to their home communities risks spreading the virus further across the country, a bad outcome for all.\nThe unique epidemiology of COVID-19 in young adults, along with the contact patterns on college campuses and the inability to effectively screen through symptom reports or diagnostic testing, have left college campuses with few options for safely operating with in-person classes. We know that few wanted an all-remote fall semester, but it's becoming clear that was probably our best bet.\nRyan Malosh, assistant research scientist, University of Michigan and Nina Masters, doctoral candidate, epidemiology, University of Michigan Medical School\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Townson University (Md.) and East Carolina University (N.C.) did the same.\nAt Notre Dame University, cases increased to 147 less than two weeks after the first person was diagnosed. Instead of clearing the campus, President John Jenkins consulted with the county\u2019s deputy health officer and decided to make classes remote but keep students on campus while cracking down on interactions between those living on and off-campus.\nThe Indiana school ramped up testing, added more isolation beds, and expanded contact tracing, ultimately slowing cases from spreading to surrounding communities.\nAs campuses navigate the ongoing challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, they need flexible tools to help respond to changing guidelines, procedures and precautions.

If students live nearby, tracers can do their job, said Howard Koh, former assistant secretary for health for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. If they leave the state to go home, it is less effective.\n\u201cThat will make the job very difficult, if not impossible,\u201d he said.\nAccording to Bloomberg, the U.S. has struggled with contact tracing for several reasons, including getting people to answer phone calls from public health officials and respond truthfully. It is even more difficult at colleges and universities where students are being disciplined for violating rules. For instance, an outbreak at SUNY Oneonta led to the suspension of five students and three campus organizations.\nStudents are also excited to be back at school with their peers, leading many to break rules put forth by schools on social gatherings.\n\u201cThe more contacts a person has, the harder contact tracing can be,\u201d said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. \u201cPeople may not even know who they\u2019re in contact with, especially if they are drinking.\u201d _ https://www.campussafetymagazine.com/university/colleges-covid-19-outbreaks/ _ Campus Safety Magazine _ 2020-09-01 | "}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-89.38644000000001, 43.07313]}, "properties": {"weight": 8.158883083359672, "name": "UW-Madison", "descriptions": "Coronavirus <b>outbreak</b> threatens to shut down UW-Madison campus _ A campus <b>COVID-19</b> <b>outbreak</b> at <b>University</b> of Wisconsin-Madison is threatening the semester, a semester that&#39;s not even a week old.

Two new state studies aim to find out\nIt may seem like a wacky strategy, but it's not. After research showed the virus can be shed through stool and bodily fluids, studies have appeared in the U.S. and across the world to track the virus in this way. Such a study is underway across the state of Wisconsin and will conclude in June.\nAnd it's especially popular on college campuses, including UW-Madison, which is doing its own wastewater testing this year. At the University of Arizona, the testing alerted a pending outbreak in late August and officials were able to head it off before it spread.\nUW-Oshkosh's lab is already collecting wastewater samples from local health care facilities for the same purpose, according to the university.\nResidence hall testing will begin soon and is expected to give school leaders an approximate idea of how the virus is moving on campus.\n\"We\u2019ll get a relative abundance \u2014 is it high, low, is there any?\u201d Greg Kleinheinz, director of the lab and professor of environmental engineering technology, said in the announcement. \u201cThat\u2019ll help kind of drive what happens next.\"\nContact Madeline Heim at 920-996-7266 or mheim@gannett.com.

From March to mid-August, the town of 25,000 had recorded only 42 coronavirus cases.\nBut in the past month, that number has more than quintupled to 220 cases, with nearly all of those new cases reported from within the UConn student body. In a bid to contain the spread, an entire dorm was locked down, then a bar was shuttered. Now an off-campus apartment complex in Storrs Center is under quarantine.\nA month after many Connecticut college students returned to school, COVID-19 cases at UConn and some other university campuses have played a significant role in the state\u2019s recent uptick in coronavirus infections \u2014 a development many feared with the resumption of classes.\nGov. Ned Lamont Thursday noted \u201cconcerning\u201d trends in Connecticut\u2019s COVID-19 numbers, as the state\u2019s rate of positive tests ticked up and the number of hospitalized patients climbed to its highest level in more than two months.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a number of cases at UConn, there\u2019s been some at Central,\u201d the state\u2019s chief operating officer, Josh Geballe, said Thursday as he discussed the state\u2019s recent rise in COVID-19 cases and rate of positive cases. \u201cThose seem contained at this point \u2014 I think the administrations there have taken all the right actions \u2014 but those do drive case numbers.\u201d\nBut the experience has differed from one campus to the next, and from one college town to another.\nIn Mansfield, significant coronavirus outbreaks at UConn have yet to spill over into the broader community. But in New Britain, cases among Central Connecticut State students help explain a recent uptick citywide. In Middletown, New Haven and elsewhere, cases have remained low on local campuses, resulting in no apparent spike in cases. And in Windham, the town has recorded an uptick in coronavirus cases even while Eastern Connecticut State has seen a relatively low number of cases.\nDue in part to wide variations in testing standards from school to school, the return to college campuses in Connecticut has resulted in a patchwork of issues \u2014 met by a similar patchwork of solutions.\nConcern over community spread\nStatewide, after weeks of positive test rates below the gold standard of 1 percent, Connecticut has seen its positivity rate climb over the past week and a half, while hospitalizations have reached higher levels than recorded since July.\nThose increases have coincided with the reopening of college campuses. And while returning college students certainly do not account for the entirety of the state\u2019s increased numbers, the cases identified among university students and staff have undoubtedly contributed to the Connecticut\u2019s coronavirus uptick.\nUConn\u2019s cases have nearly singlehandedly pushed Tolland County into one of the highest per capita infection rates in the state. From Aug. 14 to Sept. 17, Tolland County reported 233 new coronavirus cases \u2014 in about the same time period, UConn reported well over 250 cases, although some of those cases were likely reported in students' hometowns outside of Tolland County.\nBefore UConn students returned to campus, local officials worried that coronavirus-positive students \u2014 particularly those who were asymptomatic \u2014 would bring the virus into Mansfield and then spread it to year-round residents, including elderly residents.\nThat concern drove Mansfield officials to push for additional restrictions on gatherings within the town. Mansfield officials, along with officials from Windham and West Hartford, lobbied the state for approval to decrease the maximum size of gatherings allowed, but Lamont\u2019s administration never formally responded to that request.\nHowever, so far Mansfield\u2019s fears haven\u2019t materialized. The town hasn\u2019t seen significant COVID-19 spread spilling over from the UConn campus, according to Eastern Highlands Health Director Robert Miller.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a very low prevalence of cases among Mansfield residents,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing any indication, based on the current data, that there\u2019s an increased risk of spread among [the] non-student population in the Mansfield area.\u201d\nCCSU, meanwhile, has seen 19 cases among residential students and staff over the past week and currently has 15 students in isolation and another 15 under supervision in quarantine. In total, CCSU has recorded more than 60 cases among students, faculty and staff since reopening its campus in mid-August, behind only UConn among Connecticut colleges that have reported numbers regularly.\nUnlike UConn, CCSU has been part of a broader uptick in its surrounding community, as cases have risen in New Britain. The city has recorded more than 100 cases over the past two weeks, according to state numbers, and had the second most cases of any Connecticut municipality between August 30 and September 12.\nSergio Lupo, the city\u2019s health director said \u201cthere is a concern\u201d about CCSU students who commute from surrounding towns or live off-campus in New Britain. He said health department officials were meeting with CCSU regularly to discuss containment strategy.\nEarly in the semester, CCSU President Zulma R. Toro threatened expulsions if students didn\u2019t follow safety protocols. In early September, a popular bar new campus was shut down for two weeks after being linked to a cluster of cases.\nAdditionally, the school has increased the number of residential students tested regularly and offered one-time pop-up testing for students and faculty on campus. After initially testing 5-10% of students weekly, CCSU recently announced it would now test 25%, in hopes of catching more cases.\nElsewhere, Sacred Heart University has asked students living in Bridgeport to remain off campus due to a cluster of cases, while Connecticut College has sent home students following unsanctioned social gatherings.\nIn Windham, home to Eastern Connecticut State, COVID-19 numbers have spiked in recent days. After 330 cases over the first six months of the pandemic, Windham has reported more than 50 in the past two weeks.\nECSU itself has not seen a large number of coronavirus cases \u2014 one among on-campus students, six among commuter students \u2014 but the North Central District health director, Patrice Sulik, said the school may have played a role in the town\u2019s cases.\n\u201cWe are are seeing, as expected, activity from the Eastern students,\" Sulik said. \"And we\u2019re working really closely with the college and the public school system and others to jump on it and nip it in the bud.\u201d\nDisparities in testing\nOther college towns in Connecticut have not seen an increase in coronavirus cases.\nMiddletown, home to Wesleyan, and New Haven, home to Yale and other colleges, have both dodged outbreaks. Those campuses have also implemented aggressive testing programs, which may help at least in part to explain their low case numbers.\nWhile many colleges and universities are only testing random samples of their student bodies or those with COVID-19 symptoms, Yale and Wesleyan have both committed to testing all students and staff every week. Officials say that allows them to catch cases early, before the virus has a chance to spread through the campus and town populations.\nFrom September 9 to 15, Yale tested 4,931 students and 1,119 faculty and staff, discovering only three cases. The school has recorded 16 total cases since the start of August, according to its official dashboard.\nWesleyan has found similar success, testing 3,493 students and employees and finding only six total cases.\nUConn has been testing less aggressively than Wesleyan and Yale, but still more than other state schools.\nBut even some schools with limited COVID-19 testing have so far avoided cases. In addition to Yale, New Haven\u2019s other colleges \u2014 Southern Connecticut State and Albertus Magnus \u2014 have similarly kept their numbers low, despite less ambitious testing programs.\n\u201cWe have a task force ready to respond but so far we have received zero complaints,\u201d New Haven Health Director Maritza Bond said.\n\u201cThere are inconsistencies across the state as to what each college is doing as far as testing and who is getting tested,\u201d Bond said.\nOther colleges that have largely avoided significant outbreaks include:\nTrinity College, which has recorded 17 cases since mid-August, though 15 in the past two weeks.\nThe University of Hartford, which also has 17 total cases since August, as of Tuesday.\nThe University of New Haven, which has recorded two cases.\nFairfield University, which had seven total cases as of September 10.\nThe University of Bridgeport, which has recorded one case as of Tuesday.\nQuinnipiac University, which has not yet recorded a positive test.\nAlex Putterman can be reached at aputterman@courant.com.

(AP) \u2014 An upstate New York college is suspending in-person classes for two weeks because of a coronavirus outbreak, officials announced Friday, but campus will stay open and students won't be sent home.\nThe State University of New York at Oswego announced the shift to remote learning beginning Sept. 19 as a proactive measure as it neared the state's shutdown threshold of 100 COVID-19 cases, college president Deborah Stanley said.\nSUNY Oswego had tallied 82 virus cases as of Friday and was projected to reach the 100-case mark on Sept. 25, Stanley wrote in a letter to students and staff and posted on the college's website.\n\u201cIn that light, we determined that taking a pause in order to manage the virus with the goal of containing it on our campus is best for our entire college community,\u201d Stanley wrote in the letter.\nThe suspension of in-person classes affects the main campus in Oswego and a satellite campus about 34 miles (55 kilometers) south in Syracuse. All extracurricular programs and student activities deemed non-essential are also being suspended.\nStanley said the college plans to resume regular classes on Oct. 5. About 8,000 students attend SUNY Oswego.\nIn the meantime, she said, students will be required to limit movement to essential needs, such as going to work, medical appointments and to pick up food. They will also continue to have access to labs, studios, health care and other student services.\nAnother state-run college, SUNY Oneonta, closed its campus Sept. 3 and shifted to online classes for the remainder of the fall semester after seeing nearly 400 cases of coronavirus. _ https://www.middletownpress.com/news/article/SUNY-Oswego-halts-in-person-classes-amid-COVID-19-15578441.php _ The Middletown Press _ 2020-09-18 | "}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-74.44384000000001, 40.49477]}, "properties": {"weight": 6.079441541679836, "name": "Rutgers University", "descriptions": "Four Rutgers athletes, athletics staff member test positive for <b>COVID-19</b> _ Many athletics programs across the country in recent weeks have dealt with <b>COVID-19</b> <b>outbreaks</b>, especially as general student populations began returning to campus.

We\u2019ve learned that the virus that causes COVID-19 transmits particularly well when a group of people are together in a small, poorly ventilated area. We\u2019ve learned that young people are just as susceptible as older people to infection. We\u2019ve learned that if there is widespread community transmission, the virus will find its way to the very places we don\u2019t want it go.\nSo, it\u2019s not surprising to us, researchers who study diseases that can be prevented by vaccines, that with schools and colleges reopening, the virus is spreading.\nThese are places designed around the idea of bringing lots of people to one place. Many of them bring people together from all over the world. They are perfect places for disease to spread.\nBack in March, colleges and universities closed down like everything else except essential businesses. They sent students home. There was a rough transition to online instruction. Students weren\u2019t happy, faculty weren\u2019t happy. And so, they started to come up with plans on how to reopen for in-person instruction for the fall semester.\nMany places installed plexi-glass barriers in classrooms, considered mask mandates and worked out physical distancing in lecture halls. Most people realized that professors who taught large classes should plan for remote learning.\nUniversity administrators and public health experts started making these plans in the spring. Back then, we scientists and public health researchers all operated under the assumption that community spread would be under some sort of control by fall. We all thought that the country would increase testing capacity, and we have. Then, once new cases dropped to a low level, we could institute contact tracing, the way other countries had.\nBut that part hasn\u2019t happened. And so now these same colleges and universities are facing huge increases in cases, including at the University of North Carolina, Notre Dame and the University of Alabama. Many universities that have opted to return to in-person classes are also having a surge in cases. These outbreaks will inevitably spread to the wider communities in which the campuses are located.\nIt seems that for many of these institutions, the priority was on financial concerns, which involved a return to a normal fall semester to the greatest extent possible. They then developed plans that they thought would make this possible. Faculty at many institutions and at least one ethics committee have argued that the priority should have been the safety of students, faculty and the surrounding communities.\nWhile schools across the country have different priorities, enrollments, campus size, and student demographics, many schools share one thing in common: making no real contingency plans around reopening amid COVID-19, other than going remote if governors mandated it.\nThe schools that did spend the summer figuring out how to deliver high quality education remotely, or how to safely provide housing and access to services for the most vulnerable students, are less likely to have their fall semester disrupted. However, the College Crisis Initiative\u2019s data dashboard found that only 7% of 1,442 four-year schools surveyed were planning on a fully online fall semester.\nAnd so, the inevitable has come to pass. Now, many college campuses will struggle to control their outbreaks, because there are a lot of unique challenges inherent to COVID-19 in this population.\nColleges are not nursing homes or prisons. Some are trying to limit contact with the broader community.\nBut in general, students are not kept under lock and key. They have visitors from other schools. They go back and forth to their parents\u2019 homes. And, yes, they go to parties. To us, blaming students for wanting a normal-ish college experience when the schools themselves have set the tone for trying hard to return to normal isn\u2019t fair.\nIt\u2019s also true that not all of the contact students have is as irresponsible as some have suggested. Many students hold jobs in the communities that surround the school. And most of these jobs aren\u2019t typically the work-from-home type of job. In our undergraduate careers we both worked at jobs that had high contact rates with the community. And often, when your job is waiting tables at a local pizza place or manning a library desk, most of your colleagues are students as well. All of these factors will make contact tracing very hard.\nPublic health experts also expect a relatively high proportion of college-aged students to be either completely asymptomatic or to only have very mild symptoms. Without universal testing, these students won\u2019t know they\u2019re sick. They may not isolate if they have mild symptoms. But they will still be able to spread the virus to others. Symptom and temperature screenings may not recognize these individuals as those who need to stay away from campus buildings.\nWhich brings us to testing. Some places are doing universal testing of students, multiple times per week. But, given the state of testing in the U.S., that is not a realistic possibility for most schools.\nLet\u2019s look at our university as an example. The University of Michigan has an undergraduate population of 30,000 students. Let\u2019s assume that two-thirds of them came back to campus. That means 40,000 tests per week just for University of Michigan undergraduate students. Right now the entire state of Michigan is doing a little more than 200,000 diagnostic tests per week. Someschools have developed their own tests to handle this huge increase in capacity. But many university labs are involved in testing for large health systems and the rest of the state too. In these places it becomes very difficult for 1 in 5 tests available in an entire state to be dedicated to the students at a single university.\nA scale-up of rapid, at-home antigen tests could be one approach to make testing on this scale feasible. These types of tests have the advantage of detecting highly infectious individuals \u2013 making them a good screening tool \u2013 but many are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration because they aren\u2019t as sensitive as the standard PCR-based diagnostic test.\nIf transmission on campus continues to happen mostly outside of the classroom, simply going remote will not solve the problem.

Instead, they need to focus on safely sending students back home without spreading the virus to their home communities.\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\nScientists have learned a few things over the past six months as the COVID-19 pandemic has continued. We've learned that the virus that causes COVID-19 transmits particularly well when a group of people are together in a small, poorly ventilated area. We've learned that young people are just as susceptible as older people to infection. We've learned that if there is widespread community transmission, the virus will find its way to the very places we don't want it go.\nSo, it's not surprising to us, researchers who study diseases that can be prevented by vaccines, that with schools and colleges reopening, the virus is spreading.\nThese are places designed around the idea of bringing lots of people to one place. Many of them bring people together from all over the world. They are perfect places for disease to spread.\nHow we got here\nBack in March, colleges and universities closed down like everything else except essential businesses. They sent students home. There was a rough transition to online instruction. Students weren't happy, faculty weren't happy. And so, they started to come up with plans on how to reopen for in-person instruction for the fall semester.\nMany places installed plexi-glass barriers in classrooms, considered mask mandates, and worked out physical distancing in lecture halls. Most people realized that professors who taught large classes should plan for remote learning.\nUniversity administrators and public health experts started making these plans in the spring. Back then, we scientists and public health researchers all operated under the assumption that community spread would be under some sort of control by fall. We all thought that the country would increase testing capacity, and we have. Then, once new cases dropped to a low level, we could institute contact tracing, the way other countries had.\nBut that part hasn't happened. And so now these same colleges and universities are facing huge increases in cases, including at the University of North Carolina, Notre Dame, and the University of Alabama. Many universities that have opted to return to in-person classes are also having a surge in cases. These outbreaks will inevitably spread to the wider communities in which the campuses are located.\nIt seems that for many of these institutions, the priority was on financial concerns, which involved a return to a normal fall semester to the greatest extent possible. They then developed plans that they thought would make this possible. Faculty at many institutions and at least one ethics committee have argued that the priority should have been the safety of students, faculty, and the surrounding communities.\nWhile schools across the country have different priorities, enrollments, campus size, and student demographics, many schools share one thing in common: making no real contingency plans around reopening amid COVID-19, other than going remote if governors mandated it.\nThe schools that did spend the summer figuring out how to deliver high quality education remotely, or how to safely provide housing and access to services for the most vulnerable students, are less likely to have their fall semester disrupted. However, the College Crisis Initiative's data dashboard found that only 7% of 1,442 four-year schools surveyed were planning on a fully online fall semester.\nThe challenge ahead\nAnd so, the inevitable has come to pass. Now, many college campuses will struggle to control their outbreaks, because there are a lot of unique challenges inherent to COVID-19 in this population.\nColleges are not nursing homes or prisons. Some are trying to limit contact with the broader community.\nBut in general, students are not kept under lock and key. They have visitors from other schools. They go back and forth to their parents' homes. And, yes, they go to parties. To us, blaming students for wanting a normal-ish college experience when the schools themselves have set the tone for trying hard to return to normal isn't fair.\nIt's also true that not all of the contact students have is as irresponsible as some have suggested. Many students hold jobs in the communities that surround the school. And most of these jobs aren't typically the work-from-home type of job. In our undergraduate careers we both worked at jobs that had high contact rates with the community. And often, when your job is waiting tables at a local pizza place or manning a library desk, most of your colleagues are students as well. All of these factors will make contact tracing very hard.\nPublic health experts also expect a relatively high proportion of college-aged students to be either completely asymptomatic or to only have very mild symptoms. Without universal testing, these students won't know they're sick. They may not isolate if they have mild symptoms. But they will still be able to spread the virus to others. Symptom and temperature screenings may not recognize these individuals as those who need to stay away from campus buildings.\nA different kind of campus test\nWhich brings us to testing. Some places are doing universal testing of students, multiple times per week. But, given the state of testing in the US, that is not a realistic possibility for most schools.\nLet's look at our university as an example. The University of Michigan has an undergraduate population of 30,000 students. Let's assume that two-thirds of them came back to campus. That means 40,000 tests per week just for University of Michigan undergraduate students. Right now the entire state of Michigan is doing a little more than 200,000 diagnostic tests per week. Some schools have developed their own tests to handle this huge increase in capacity. But many university labs are involved in testing for large health systems and the rest of the state too. In these places it becomes very difficult for one in five tests available in an entire state to be dedicated to the students at a single university.\nA scale-up of rapid, at-home antigen tests could be one approach to make testing on this scale feasible. These types of tests have the advantage of detecting highly infectious individuals \u2014 making them a good screening tool \u2014 but many are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration because they aren't as sensitive as the standard PCR-based diagnostic test.\nIf transmission on campus continues to happen mostly outside of the classroom, simply going remote will not solve the problem. Keeping students on campus will be risky. Many students will be attempting to navigate social distancing guidelines without a traditional social support network.\nAs much as possible, we believe students need to be able to safely return to their homes. But this can't be done haphazardly. Bringing them to campus was a predictable risk \u2014 so is sending them home. As colleges inevitably move back to online instruction, plans must be put in place to minimize the risk of seeding epidemics. Dismissing all students, some of whom are infectious, back to their home communities risks spreading the virus further across the country, a bad outcome for all.\nThe unique epidemiology of COVID-19 in young adults, along with the contact patterns on college campuses and the inability to effectively screen through symptom reports or diagnostic testing, have left college campuses with few options for safely operating with in-person classes.

The university consolidated student housing to clear room to quarantine students, banned student events and encouraged compliance with preventative measures.\nBut many students worry it was too little, too late. And some students say UA has not done enough to protect them from contracting the virus.\nSeveral days a week, Carlee Fernandez works as a front desk assistant at Burke Hall, a red-brick residence hall that rises five floors above Paul W. Bryant Drive on the south end of UA\u2019s campus.\nIt\u2019s a pretty typical student desk job: check people in, help out when students lose their keys or lock themselves out of their dorm rooms, and perform other basic administrative tasks. But as of last week, the position put Fernandez, a 22-year-old UA senior from Helena, on the front lines of one of the nation\u2019s most severe campus COVID-19 outbreaks.\nOn Monday, the university announced that all students living on one side of Burke Hall would have to move out to free up rooms to isolate and quarantine students who test positive for the virus or come in contact with someone who has.\nFour days later, UA reported that the university added 481 new student COVID-19 cases from Tuesday to Thursday, a rapid escalation given that there were 562 new student cases over the previous six days. The university also reported Friday that over 36% of its isolation space in Tuscaloosa was occupied.\nFor Fernandez, concerns about the rising case count were compounded by her belief that there has been \u201ca complete lack of transparency and communication from the university\u201d about its plans for quarantining students and how it is protecting healthy students, employees and faculty. She said she first learned via Twitter that the school was converting half of the building where she works to isolation space.\n\u201cIf there\u2019s no communication, if we\u2019re not being informed on how to deal with COVID patients as a desk assistant, we could all be at risk of contracting COVID,\u201d Fernandez said in a phone interview Saturday. \u201cA lot of us are really concerned and scared, not only for ourselves, but for the other housing staff and students.\u201d\nLack of guidance\nBurke Hall has two towers - Burke West and Burke East - connected by a wide shared space on the ground floor. Burke West was the one cleared out last week to make room for students under quarantine. The front desk Fernandez works behind is in the middle of the shared ground-floor space, where she and her co-workers greet and help residents of both towers.\nAny job that requires workers to sit for hours in an indoor space and interact with members of the public carries a level of risk during a viral pandemic. But what concerns Fernandez is her belief that UA has done too little to limit her and her co-workers\u2019 exposure to the virus. She said the university has provided gloves, hand sanitizer and masks for months, but did not offer additional training or materials to help keep employees who must now interact directly with sick and exposed students from contracting COVID-19 themselves.\nClear Plexiglas barriers between the ceiling and two higher tiers of the Burke Hall front desk provide some protection. But the lower, central tier of the desk - which is where most conversations and exchanges take place - had no such barrier in place as of Saturday evening.\nYet numerous students had already moved into the hall\u2019s designated COVID-19 tower. Fernandez told AL.com she has personally seen students moving into Burke West.\n\u201cThe students are coming in. A few of them came up to the front desk just with their masks on and their stuff in their hands and were like, \u2018I\u2019m here to move into isolation. What do I do?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWe were never told what to do if someone comes for isolation, we were just told that they might clear Burke West for isolation if needed.\u201d\nMonica Watts, a spokeswoman for UA, said in an emailed statement Friday that the school\u2019s \u201ctop priority\u201d is safety:\n\u201cAs we prepared for the fall semester, we worked closely with student leaders, faculty members and our staff to develop plans to minimize the risk of COVID-19 and to respond as cases occurred \u2026 For students who are in isolation or quarantine, we are providing meals and comprehensive services to address all aspects of support and care.\u201d\nInstead of hands-on training, Fernandez said she and her co-workers were given a one-page list of frequently asked questions with short pre-written responses to consult if they are asked any of six specific questions about the school\u2019s decision to relocate students to make room for additional isolation space.\n\u201cWhy are we having to move?\u201d reads one of the questions. \u201c[Housing and Residential Communities] was trying to be proactive and create isolation spaces in case they are needed.\u201d\nSince then, Fernandez says she has spoken on the phone with Myron Pope, UA\u2019s vice president for student life, about her concerns. She provided AL.com with a copy of notes he sent her listing specific suggestions she had made for improving safety at the Burke Hall front desk.\nThe ideas include installing more Plexiglas, adding signage to direct students to use side doors when possible, providing \u201ctraining on how to deal with COVID positive students,\u201d and communicating better with employees. As of Saturday, the changes had yet to be instituted, according to Fernandez.\n\u2018I was devastated\u2019\nMorgan Quillin was only six days into her freshman year at UA when she received an email from the university stating that she had two days to move out of Burke West and into a room in Burke East. The 18-year-old nursing major, who was already reeling from the experience of moving from her hometown of Huntsville into her first dorm in the middle of a global pandemic, said she was shocked to learn she would have to move again so soon.\n\u201cWe had no idea where we were going to be moving or if my roommate and I would be separated. A lot of things were up in the air. I had a panic attack while my roommate was frantically packing and trying to console me,\u201d Quillin told AL.com. \u201cI was devastated and so incredibly scared. I felt abandoned by the school I\u2019ve looked up to my whole life.\u201d\nThe next day, she and her roommate - who asked to remain anonymous - learned they had been assigned separate rooms, but that they would both be on the same floor in Burke East. They filed a work order and slept in their new rooms Tuesday night. On Wednesday morning, Quillin awoke to an email from a UA Housing representative who apologized for the mix-up and was ultimately able to get her reassigned to live with her original roommate.\nWatts said Friday that \u201c[s]ome students were recently relocated as we consolidated residence hall space - a standard practice each year as we attempt to make the most efficient use of space - and to make more room for potential COVID-19 isolation. Students who were moved did not incur additional costs and were provided assistance and incentives to make up for their inconvenience.\u201d\nWhile she appreciates the university\u2019s efforts to right the situation, Quillin says she is still upset about the way she was treated.\n\u201cMy biggest concern while moving was the fact that I didn\u2019t know who I was going to be rooming with,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they had been social distancing or wearing a mask or anything.\u201d\nA big deal\nLila Bogle, a 19-year-old UA sophomore from Franklin, Tenn., was sitting in a cavernous lecture hall with dozens of other students for her statistics class last week when a student behind her sneezed. When Bogle turned around to say bless you, the student\u2019s mask had been pulled down. Bogle asked her why her mask was not covering her nose and mouth in accordance with university policy.\n\u201cShe was like, \u2018I only pulled down my mask to sneeze, it\u2019s not that big of a deal,\u2019\u201d Bogle recalled. \u201cBut it is that big of a deal! I couldn\u2019t believe that she said that because what do you think you\u2019re wearing a mask for?\u201d\nBogle, who lives in an on-campus residence hall that the university has not converted to isolation space, said that kind of dismissive attitude toward basic preventative measures is common among some UA students. So she stays in her room as much as possible and wears a mask whenever she leaves, as she is worried about the proliferation of COVID-19 and what she sees as insufficient action by UA to slow its spread.\n\u201cI think a lot of people aren\u2019t taking it very seriously,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is some partying and going out still, just based on hearing girls arrive back at their rooms on weekends and sounding drunk when they get back. I think the step that [the city of Tuscaloosa] took shutting down the bars was a good step to try to crack down. But I think to really crack down on it they\u2019d have to start having rules about people leaving their rooms and their dorms.\u201d\nMost of the other students and faculty who spoke with AL.com since Thursday also said they have been disappointed by the unwillingness of a significant portion of the student body to take common-sense steps to avoid spreading the coronavirus, like social distancing, avoiding crowded indoor areas and wearing masks.\n\u201cMost students seem to be following social distancing guidelines, but some aren\u2019t. It\u2019s those few that are ruining it for everyone,\u201d Quillin said. \u201cIt\u2019s been disappointing seeing my peers have such complete disregard for everyone else\u2019s health and safety.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s to be done\nWhile the case count continues to grow and frustrations and fears fester on campus, students and faculty worry what will come of the rest of the semester at UA. Nearly all of the more than a dozen students and faculty who spoke with AL.com since Wednesday said they believe the university will likely cancel in-person classes soon, for better or worse.\n\u201cMy roommate and I have not completely unpacked. We\u2019re scared we\u2019ll get sent home within the next week or two and will have to do this process all over again,\u201d Quillin said.\n\u201cI feel that the university should just send everyone home. This just isn\u2019t working. I expected campus to be lively and exciting, but it\u2019s just been so disappointing,\u201d\nBogle said that while she believes the university has taken some positive steps in recent days to limit the spread of coronavirus and avoid canceling in-person classes, she worries that they may not be enough.\n\u201cThere\u2019s only so much that they can actually do past what they\u2019ve already done, short of getting rid of in-person classes,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI think that if people aren\u2019t on campus, then nobody is on campus to get [COVID-19.] So it\u2019s a good move for the general student body. But I\u2019m also conflicted about it because I struggled last semester with online classes because I can\u2019t learn like that. So it\u2019s kind of lose-lose for me.\u201d\nWatts, the UA spokeswoman, said the university has taken a proactive approach to limiting the spread of COVID-19 on campus.\n\u201cIn the last week, we have implemented a moratorium on student events and taken additional steps to reduce the virus\u2019 spread. The City of Tuscaloosa suspended on-premise consumption of alcohol at bars for 14 days, beginning last Monday,\u201d Watts said. \u201cWe are confident these measures will do everything possible to help bend the curve.\u201d\nFernandez said she believes it\u2019s too late for UA to significantly slow the spread and that she does not believe there is anything the school could do to make her feel safe on campus.\n\u201cI have been concerned since the day I found out we were going back to campus. This is just insane. There are schools that have closed because they had 80 cases and we\u2019ve had over 1,000 in a week and we\u2019re still open,\u201d she said.\n\u201cFor me I just want to feel safe, and I want other people to feel safe, too. But I don\u2019t think anything\u2019s going to make me feel safe.\u201d\nNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission. _ https://www.al.com/news/2020/08/this-is-just-insane-students-say-ua-is-doing-too-little-to-protect-them-from-covid-19.html _ al.com _ 2020-09-03 | Tensions rise between college towns and universities as <b>outbreaks</b> emerge among students returning to campus _ RALEIGH, N.C. \u2014 As more and more schools and businesses around the country get the OK to reopen, college towns are moving in the opposite direction because of too much partying and too many COVID-19 infections among students.\nWith more than 300 students at the University of Missouri testing positive for the coronavirus and an alarming 44% positivity rate for the surrounding county, the local health director Friday ordered bars to stop serving alcohol at 9 p.m. and close by 10 p.m.\nEarlier this week, Iowa\u2019s governor ordered all bars shut down around Iowa University and Iowa State, while the mayor of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, did the same in the hometown of the state\u2019s flagship university.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing in our violations is they\u2019re coming late at night,\u201d said Stephanie Browning, head of the health department for Columbia, Missouri. \u201cBig groups gathering. They\u2019re not wearing their masks, they\u2019re not social distancing.\u201d\nIn Provo, Utah, the home of Brigham Young University, the Municipal Council passed a mask ordinance over the mayor\u2019s veto because of the influx of students from around the country for the start of classes Monday.\nThe outbreaks since students began returning to campus in the past few weeks have heightened town-gown tensions and led to recriminations between local politicians and university officials.\nMeanwhile, California announced a four-tiered, color-coded plan Friday for gradually reopening businesses. It requires counties to meet certain benchmarks showing progress in controlling the virus. Gov. Gavin Newsom abandoned a reopening attempt earlier this summer because of a surge in cases.\nIn Arizona, another deadly hot spot this summer, a drop in transmission numbers allowed the Phoenix and Tucson areas to reopen gyms and some bars on Thursday. And Ohio let theater groups this week resume performances with strict audience caps.\nThe U.S. has recorded over 180,000 deaths from the coronavirus and 5.9 million confirmed infections. Worldwide, the death toll is put at more than 830,000, with at least 24.5 million cases.\nSurging infection numbers around the U.S. have been blamed in part on young people ignoring mask and social distancing requirements.\nBrowning, who also slapped a 20-person limit on crowds, said the percentage of tests coming back positive for the virus in the county is roughly four times higher than before students returned to classes. Chancellor Mun Choi said the university is not considering going to online-only classes, but it is canceling some events, including the homecoming parade in October.\nIn Iowa\u2019s Story County, where Iowa State is situated, 74% of new cases over the past seven days were among people ages 19 to 24, Gov. Kim Reynolds said Thursday. In the same time period, 69% of new cases in Johnson County, the home of the University of Iowa, were in that age group.\n\u201cIt is increasing the virus activity in the community, and it\u2019s spilling over to other segments of the population,\u201d Reynolds said.\nThe University of Alabama has recorded over 500 cases of COVID-19 on campus since the fall semester began last week. In closing the town\u2019s bars Monday for the next two weeks, Mayor Walt Maddox said that an unchecked spread of the virus threatens both the health care system and the local economy if students have to be sent home for the semester for remote learning.\nThree of North Carolina\u2019s largest public universities have abruptly halted in-person undergraduate instruction and directed students to move out of the dorms after hundreds tested positive following their return to campus. Nearly 800 have been confirmed infected at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, more than 670 at North Carolina State and around 300 at East Carolina University.\nLeaders at UNC-Chapel Hill, which has shifted to online classes, wrote an open letter Thursday to the mayor outlining steps the university is taking to curb off-campus parties, including disciplinary measures and combined patrols between campus and town police.\n\u201cWe recognize the very real problems with the behaviors of some of our fraternities and sororities,\u201d the university\u2019s chancellor and provost assured the mayor.\nChapel Hill\u2019s mayor and members of the Town Council had written to the school last week urging it to expand virus testing, update its infection figures more often and spell out what discipline students would face for violating school rules and local ordinances. The local leaders decried the \u201cvacuum left by the university\u2019s decision to take minimal responsibility for students when they are off campus.\u201d\nOyeronke Popoola, a 17-year-old freshman at UNC-Chapel Hill who moved out of her dorm, said that administrators, not students, deserve most of the blame for the virus-related problems after they ushered students back to campus.\n\u201cThey should\u2019ve put everything online from the beginning, but they wanted the money,\u201d she said. And she said fraternities and sororities weren\u2019t the only ones at fault among the students: \u201cI feel like Greek life gets a lot of blame, which is understandable, but there are other students who were meeting without masks that were not a part of Greek life.\u201d\nElsewhere around the world, the British government encouraged workers to return to their offices amid concerns that working from home is hurting coffee shops, restaurants and other businesses in city centers. The government plans to launch a media campaign next week to help reassure the public.\nItaly reported nearly 1,500 new infections Friday, its highest day-to-day increase since May, even as the country moves toward reopening schools in two weeks.\nTwo other European countries moved to restrict travel, with Hungary announcing it will close its borders to foreigners and Greece suspending flights from Barcelona and other airports in northern Spain because of a spike in infections there. _ https://www.chicagotribune.com/nation-world/ct-nw-college-towns-coronavirus-20200828-j4m3enp5ofgzbkirb52r64pjre-story.html _ Chicago Tribune _ 2020-08-28 | College towns growing alarmed over coronavirus <b>outbreaks</b> among students _ The <b>outbreaks</b> since students began ... by essential workers and young people.

That pushes the UA total to 2,302 since classes began Aug. 19.\nIn terms of isolation/quarantine space, the school reports 3.88% occupancy.\nNumbers also remained low at UAB (18 positives) and UA-Huntsville (19 positives).\nThere was a slight increase in positive cases among faculty and staff in Tuscaloosa. There were 17 positives this week after 13 last week for a total of 51 since classes started.\nUniversity of Alabama System Chancellor Finis St. John spoke Thursday at the trustees meeting about the response to the COVID-19 outbreak on campus.\n\u201cWe also faced worrisome trends on our campuses, but the difference is we were prepared,\u201d St. John said Thursday. \"We had a plan. We addressed the issues as they arose and we held our nerve despite difficult publicity and calls for us to change course and give up, we trusted our plan and our people.

They are asking the city for better ventilation, uniform mask requirements in schools, and greater testing capacity.\nAsked about the turmoil, Cuomo said that the power should be in the teachers\u2019 hands to decide whether or not measures from their respective school districts (including the city\u2019s Department of Education, which counts as one district for all New York City) are adequate.\n\u201cThe local school districts don\u2019t need me to say in New York City when the children should wear a mask or in Buffalo or Long Island.

Cuomo Deploys SWAT Team to SUNY Oneonta to Contain <b>COVID-19</b> <b>Outbreak</b> _ Governor Andrew Cuomo has dispatched a COVID \u201cSWAT\u201d team to SUNY Oneonta after 105 students test positive for the virus. On Wednesday, 71 contract tracers and eight case investigators from the New York State Department of Health will set up 15- minute rapid testing sites on campus.\nThe infection that spread at SUNY Oneonta has been linked to several student parties in and around campus, state officials said. Three campus organizations and five students have been suspended for participating, WNBC-TV reported.\nSUNY Oneonta's Incoming Chancellor, Jim Malatras said the school will close for in-person instruction for the next two weeks. The suspension went into effect Sun. Aug. 30 at 9 p.m. and run through Sept. 13. At that time state, school officials and the local health department will determine if it is safe for in-person learning to resume.\nCOVID-19 cases started to surface last week at SUNY Oneonta when undergraduate students returned to school for the fall semester. It was reported that only 20 people tested positive. However, once a SUNY upstate medical team was dispatched and 3,000 students were tested, the total number of confirmed cases of COVID 19 reached 105, representing 3% of the faculty, staff, and students who are on campus and using campus facilities, university officials said.\n\u201cColleges are the canary in the coal mine, and a 3 percent infection rate is high in a congregate situation, similar to a dense urban environment where you have people taking public transportation,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re deploying state resources to contact the new COVID cluster at SUNY Oneonta.\u201d\nCuomo applauded Malatras for his actions, saying, \"the chancellor is doing the exact right thing at Oneonta and I think he's taking the right actions across SUNY, and I think the private colleges should follow the example,\" reported by FOX News.\nOn Aug. 27, Cuomo announced that 100 cases are the minimum necessary to force a campus closure or an outbreak of 5 percent of the population. If a college outbreak occurs, students are required to do remote learning with limited on-campus activity for two weeks while the situation is evaluated by health officials. If the local health department finds the college cannot contain the outbreak even after the two weeks, the school may be required to continue remote learning or officials may impose other mitigation measures in consultation with the state health department.\nThe guidelines also state that if clusters of positive cases emerge on particular areas of campus while still below 5% or under 100 students, but \"strain the college's ability to isolate and contact trace,\" the college has to shift to 100% distance learning \"with limited on-campus activity.\u201d\nAthletic activities and other extracurricular activities must also be suspended, and the dining hall option must move to take-out only.\nLast week it was reported that more than 1,000 University of Alabama students tested positive for COVID-19 since classes resumed. SUNY Plattsburg was another college that made news headlines when officials suspended over 40 students who attended unsanctioned parties. Marist, Montclair State University and UConn were other colleges that recently failed to adhere to state and school protocols. In nearly every case of these unauthorized gatherings, reported by school officials, there was a failure to social distance and wear appropriate face coverings, reported by NBC 4 NY.\nTo help contain the outbreak in the city of Oneonta, New York State will open three free, rapid-testing sites that city residents may visit that is available by appointment.\nRELATED STORIES\nAfter Being Coronavirus-Free for Nearly a Month, New Zealand Has 2 New Cases of COVID-19 _ https://www.insideedition.com/gov-cuomo-deploys-swat-team-to-suny-oneonta-to-contain-covid-19-outbreak-61577 _ Inside Edition _ 2020-08-31 | SUNY Oneonta has worst college <b>outbreak</b> of <b>COVID-19</b> in New York _ The worst college coronavirus outbreak in New York that has forced a campus to shut down has been plagued by isolation party selfies, suspensions and even a COVID-19 SWAT team.\nThe State University of New York at Oneonta was forced to cancel in-person classes for the fall earlier this month following the huge COVID-19 outbreak.\nSince returning to campus, more than 670 students - a tenth of the student population - have tested positive for COVID-19.\nSUNY Oneonta currently has the worst on-campus COVID-19 outbreak in the state and one of the largest in the United States.\nSome have blamed the outbreak on the university's lack of COVID-19 screening when students returned to campus and a failure to monitor parties and gatherings that have been held.\nA photo that emerged earlier this month drew backlash after it showed about a dozen infected students partying in an isolation dorm on campus.\nThe photo, which was posted on social media just days after the campus switched to remote learning, showed the group of students drinking and smiling as they posed for the selfie.\nSUNY Oneonta president Barbara Jean Morris immediately slammed the photo and vowed to discipline - and possibly suspend - the students involved.\n'We have seen the photo taken in one of our residence halls of students blatantly violating our strict safety protocols and code of conduct and putting themselves and others at risk,' Morris said.\n'We are working to identify the students and will quickly issue disciplinary actions and possible suspensions. We will also step up our monitoring of these residence halls to prevent this behavior from happening again and to continue to protect the safety and health of our students.\n'It is deeply disappointing that following the severe action SUNY Oneonta took just days ago to shift to remote learning for all students, we are still faced with the reckless and irresponsible behavior of a few that are damaging the reputation of our campus and our dedicated students who followed the safety rules every day and were looking forward to a great semester on campus.'\na screenshot of a cell phone: The photo, which was posted on social media just days after the campus switched to remote learning, showed the group of students drinking and smiling as they posed for the selfie\nSUNY Oneonta had already suspended a handful of students in late August for organizing parties.\nJim Malatras, SUNY's chancellor, blamed the partying students for the outbreak on campus after more than 100 students - about three percent of the campus population - tested positive for COVID-19.\n'We have had reports of several large parties of our students at Oneonta last week, and unfortunately because of those larger gatherings, there were several students who were symptomatic of COVID,' Malatras said at the time.\n'Despite the diligence of the vast majority of our SUNY Oneonta students, faculty and staff, the actions of a few individuals who didn't comply resulted in the spread of COVID-19 over the past week.'\nThe chancellor opted to suspend classes for two weeks on August 30 as a result of the outbreak.\nIt prompted New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to intervene by sending what he described as a 'SWAT team' to the campus to help control the outbreak.\nFive days after suspending classes, the number of cases jumped to more than 500.\nMalatras announced on September 5 that the campus would cease all in-person classes and activities for the rest of the fall semester due to the outbreak.\nAs the university investigates what when wrong with their reopening plan, they are facing accusations they mishandled the COVID-19 outbreak.\nSome students and parents have slammed the school's decision not to require proof of a negative test prior to returning to campus.\nThey also say the university didn't test students once they arrived.\nMalatras, who officially became chancellor on August 31, has since said that all SUNY schools will need to develop testing plans ahead of next semester.\nSurveillance testing is now also mandatory on all campuses.\nOneonta is one of 64 campuses run by the State University of New York.\nThere are about 3,000 students based there.\nOneonta is the first to be shut down due to COVID-19 since reopening.\nRead more _ https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/suny-oneonta-has-worst-college-outbreak-of-covid-19-in-new-york/ar-BB19brpn _ Daily Mail on MSN.com _ 2020-09-18 | "}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-97.1205, 31.54699]}, "properties": {"weight": 6.079441541679836, "name": "Baylor University, WACO, Texas", "descriptions": "Baylor students asked to \u2018reside in place\u2019 after <b>COVID-19</b> <b>outbreak</b> in dorm _ WACO, Texas (KXAN) \u2014 Students in a residence hall at Baylor <b>University</b> are being asked to stay in their rooms for four days following a <b>COVID-19</b> <b>outbreak</b>.

The university remains on Level 4 out of 5 on its COVID-19 Status System and Public Health Dayton and Montgomery County are involved, working to help the university deal with the outbreak.\n\u201cThe outbreak of COVID-19 on campus was traced to several clusters of the virus that emerged among networks of students based on several small gatherings that occurred prior to the start of classes,\u201d UD officials told WDTN.com in a statement on Wednesday. \u201c(The gatherings) did not comply fully with the university\u2019s safety protocols.\u201d\nAs universities begin on-site classes for the first time since COVID-19 shut down much of the country during the spring, outbreaks have occurred on campuses across the country.

Dorm rooms are small, apartments often house many students at a time, and people living within close proximity will be susceptible to contact the virus.\n\u201cIt\u2019s similar to how it progresses in a nursing home,\u201d Dan Suffoletto of Public Health Dayton and Montgomery County said. \u201cYou have a lot of people living together and it\u2019s going to spread.\u201d\nSome students going home because of outbreak\nUD said students identified as close contacts of someone with COVID-19 needed to return home to their permanent residence if they lived within 400 miles of the campus. The idea is to allow more isolation and quarantine space for students who live outside that 400-mile range or have family members who are at high risk for the virus.

(FOX Carolina) - Furman University officials say a fraternity chapter is suspended after a COVID-19 outbreak was tied to parties held by members last weekend.\nIn updates posted online this week, Furman officials say the Iota chapter of the Kappa Alpha Order reportedly hosted parties on August 21 and 22 at the former fraternity house off campus. As a result, the university moved to quarantine 53 students due to possible exposure to the virus. Contact tracers with the university have also been speaking with attendees to figure out how many close contacts they had with others.\nWe've reached out to national leaders with the Kappa Alpha Order for comment on the suspension. According to the list of its more than 130 active collegiate chapters, the Iota chapter lists 53 chapter members as of writing.\nOn Friday, August 28, university officials announced that a COVID-19 outbreak did indeed happen, and it was the first for the campus community with eight positive cases connected to the parties. Furman leaders say more tests were administered on Friday as well, and that the school's own COVID-19 Dashboard will update Monday afternoon to reflect some or all of the new cases depending on when the test results are returned.\n\"Students, we don\u2019t know how to make this any clearer: If these types of gatherings continue, we will not be able to continue in-person classes through November 20. We want you to socialize and have safe fun, but you must adhere to the guidelines that have been established in the Paladin Promise and detailed on the Furman Focused website. This is the only way universities, including Furman, can continue in-person classes during a pandemic,\" said part of the university's second announcement on August 28.\nFurman notes the parties were not registered, and that along with the suspension of Kappa Alpha Order activities until a student organization conduct process is complete, leaders are also reviewing whether individual conduct action for violations of the Paladin Promise and other Student Conduct Code polices is appropriate. Students who violate the promise may be subject to discipline, as outlined here.\nStudent who think they have been exposed to the virus need to contact Earle Student Health Center by emailing furmanstudenthealth@prismahealth.org.\nDuring a live interview with Cody Alcorn on The Five O'Clock News on August 28, Dr. Marcus Blackstone - the chief clinical officer with the Bon Secours St. Francis Health System - said colleges and universities provide a unique concern for COVID-19 outbreaks.\n\"The concern is really with colleges.

As a precaution, school officials told 53 students who attended the parties to quarantine while they get tested for the virus.\nOn Friday, eight students who were at the parties had tested positive.\nBy Wednesday, the university said 59 people reported they were at the parties and that 32 of them were students who tested positive for COVID-19 after attending the events.\nTom Evelyn, vice president for communications with the university, said the school is still waiting on several test results from others who were in attendance and that most of the students are quarantining off campus.\n'We don't want to become the super-spreader':Citing COVID-19, Clemson Greek life goes virtual\nIn the announcement on Wednesday, the university said there was a delay in contact tracing because the school was not initially provided \"information about the events at the house and the individuals present.\"\n\"An outbreak that surpasses our ability to quarantine is one trigger that could cause us to go fully remote, and this matter quickly became an issue of wellbeing for our entire community,\" the announcement said.\nFurman brought freshmen and seniors back on campus Aug. 12-15, while sophomores and juniors are set to return Sept. 11-13. The university has 2,320 students enrolled, including 252 students who are attending the college online.\nThe university eliminated fraternity housing last year, meaning students are unable to live in or host events at the houses.\nKappa Alpha had just gotten off of probation at the university in the spring because of several unregistered events in April 2019 in Hilton Head that included alcohol. The university said students who were involved in the 2019 incidents were also involved in the house parties two weeks ago.\n\"While the organizational climate did not meet Furman\u2019s conduct expectations, these men will remain a part of our community after the conduct matters are concluded. We ask that they be treated with respect,\" the university's announcement said.\nThe university said the fraternity will have the opportunity to appeal the suspension.\nJesse Lyons, assistant executive director for advancement for the national Kappa Alpha Order, released a statement that said the Furman chapter had made a \"serious mistake,\" but that the organization would support their efforts to appeal the suspension.\n\"Kappa Alpha Order continues to advise all our members to follow campus, community, CDC, and state guidelines regarding Covid-19. The Furman chapter made a serious mistake, which we are seeing happen across the country when young people are returning to their campuses for the first time in five months,\" the statement said. \"We will work with the Furman chapter as they consider next steps, and will support them as they submit an appeal to the school\u2019s decision.\"\nAriel Gilreath is a watchdog reporter focusing on education and family issues with The Greenville News and Independent Mail.

No new cases have been reported since last week, when the state said two staff members had tested positive.\nOutbreaks have popped up in 16 other child care facilities, and 10 are still ongoing. No deaths have been linked to those facilities.\nOnly one university outbreak is considered ongoing. Colorado College has reported 14 confirmed or suspected cases among students, and none among staff. Outbreaks linked to athletic programs at Colorado State University, University of Northern Colorado and University of Colorado have been resolved, as have clusters among CSU fraternity members and University of Denver staff.\nThe largest outbreaks in the state remained mostly unchanged this week, though the cluster among Denver\u2019s homeless population did climb to the fifth-highest spot. Initially, the state reported outbreaks in homeless shelters separately, but officials changed the counting method as it became clear that the shelters\u2019 clients often sought help in multiple places where the virus was spreading.\nThe largest outbreaks were:\nSterling Correctional Facility: 611 cases, three deaths (three new cases since last week)\nVan Cise-Simonet Detention Center, Denver: 568 cases, no deaths (16 new cases)\nJBS meatpacking plant, Greeley: 293 cases, six deaths (no new cases)\nBuena Vista Correctional Complex: 212 cases, no deaths (no new cases)\nPeople experiencing homelessness, Denver: 156 cases, no deaths (15 new cases)\nPikes Peak Center nursing home, Colorado Springs: 146 cases, 26 deaths (no new cases)\nSteven Roberts Original Desserts, Aurora: 139 cases, one death (one new case)\nElms Haven Center, Thornton: 104 cases, seven deaths (44 new cases and two new deaths)\nLaurel Manor Care Center, Colorado Springs: 86 cases, 14 deaths (no new cases)\nDenver County Jail: 83 cases, no deaths (one new case)\nThe counts include both confirmed and probable cases, for consistency.

The school has not released how many beds are being used to house infected or exposed students.\nUSC reported 557 active COVID-19 cases as of Thursday, nearly a 500 percent increase from the previous weekend, the first since fall semester classes resumed with some in-person instruction.\nStudent cases have been either asymptomatic or involving minor COVID-19 symptoms before testing, the school said. No students have required hospitalization.\nThe school\u2019s outbreak has begun showing up in the state\u2019s daily COVID-19 reports.

USC was the only major public college in the state to resume with some in-person classes.\nUSC President Bob Caslen remains hopeful to keep open the campus, but he asked his staff to prepare closing plans as more than 450 students were infected last week.\nUSC hopes to stop large outbreaks by having teams ready to visit hotspots in dorms and offer saliva tests quickly to find students infected. Before, students near people who became infected were told to go out and get tests. The hotspots will be detected with wastewater testing the school is conducting that can show spikes in infections.\nOff-campus parties continue to be a concern, but a new Columbia city ordinance will punish landlords who allow large gatherings during the pandemic. Still, the school is seeing fewer large off-campus parties this year than in the past, a sign that some students are listening to safety concerns, Stensland said. _ https://www.postandcourier.com/news/usc-opens-second-covid-19-quarantine-dorm-starts-mobile-testing-for-outbreaks/article_30d2d9b8-ebb0-11ea-affc-6b162a8aa76b.html _ Post and Courier Charleston _ 2020-08-31 | UofSC sees continued drop in number of active <b>COVID-19</b> cases on campus in Friday report _ COLUMBIA, S.C.

New Mexico campuses have also limited the number of students living in dormitories this fall and taken other measures to try to slow the spread of coronavirus.\nThe University of New Mexico has had six cases since school reopened on Aug. 17. Five of those cases were students and one was an employee, said Carla Domenici, director of finance and administration for strategic initiatives, who has been named the school\u2019s COVID coordinator.\n\u201cThe leadership at UNM and the (Health Sciences Center) worked diligently (over the summer),\u201d she said. \u201cI think that hard work and thoughtfulness has worked.\u201d\nNew Mexico State University on Wednesday reported seven \u201cactive cases\u201d among students at the university and two employees with active cases. A total of 64 students and 29 university employees have tested positive since March, according to a database on NMSU\u2019s website.\nUNM has had 34 total cases across its main and branch campuses since the start of the pandemic, according to the university\u2019s COVID dashboard, which went live this week.\nWestern New Mexico University required COVID tests for all 277 students moving into residence halls on the campus in Silver City this semester. The testing found nine cases, and those students were quarantined, according to Isaac Brundage, vice president for student affairs. The university\u2019s follow-up contact tracing led to another round of rapid testing by Hidalgo Medical Services, which uncovered two more cases on the campus.\n\u201cBecause of the diligent planning WNMU conducted over the past few months, we have been successful in minimizing the spread to both our campus and local community,\u201d Brundage said in an email.\nNew Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology hasn\u2019t had any positive cases on campus, said Thom Guengerich, a spokesman. Northern New Mexico College also hasn\u2019t been made aware of any cases on its campus, according to a spokeswoman.\nOfficials at Eastern New Mexico University couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\nNew Mexico Highlands University has had seven cases at its campus in Las Vegas, all detected through required tests of student athletes, said Sean Weaver, a spokesman for the university.\n\u201cNew Mexico universities really stepped up to meet those challenges, and it was a difficult line to walk,\u201d he said.\nSuch has not been the case throughout the country. Many schools started the semester with outbreaks of disease \u2013 the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Central Florida each had more than 700 cases last week, according to a database created by The New York Times.\nRegionally, Texas Tech University and University of Texas El Paso each had 103 cases, and the University of Arizona had 78, according to the database, which was last updated Aug. 25.\nSome schools, such as Ohio State and Purdue universities, have suspended dozens of students because of large gatherings.\nAt UNM and NMSU, school officials said students have been given new conduct codes that require them to wear masks and socially distance. The colleges\u2019 deans of students will also be trying to monitor off-campus behavior to some extent, but the schools have not been made aware of parties, the officials said.\nThe cases at UNM and NMSU reflect anyone who tested positive for coronavirus through campus testing, and those who self-reported their diagnosis. Once the schools are aware of a positive test, they have contact tracers who will work to determine whether others on campus are at risk.\nUNM is sending \u201cmask ambassadors\u201d throughout campus to encourage healthy habits. Both UNM and NMSU created large outdoor seating areas where students can study or socialize at distance.\nAt NMSU, researchers are working to create a system for testing wastewater for signs of the virus. The technique has already been deployed at other colleges throughout the country, with the goal being to detect coronavirus in feces before a person starts to show symptoms.\nTesting a particular area on campus, such as a residential hall or athletic complex, could give the schools an early warning as to where the virus is present, said Lori McKee, director of health and wellness at NMSU.\nBoth UNM and NMSU also said they\u2019ve been in contact with fraternities, sororities and dorm residents, and warned them against holding large gatherings. Domenici and McKee said there could be consequences if students who are part of a campus organization hold such a party, even off campus.\n\u201cSo far, knock on wood, we haven\u2019t had any offense of large parties reported.

We need to look at institutional credibility and preservation of businesses. Governments must take actions that will impact positively on the small and medium enterprises, especially in this COVID-19 era. They must provide the enabling environment and all hands should be on deck to survive the effects of the pandemic\u201d, he said.\nManaging director of Juhel Pharmaceuticals, Dr. Eric Okoye described COVID-19 as a big trauma to many businesses, noting that it had left most SMEs in coma. He decried what he described as multiple taxations on businesses by government, remarking that without SMEs, there would be no vibrant economy.\nHe called for the development of local technology and raw materials to stabilize the economy and charged academicians to proffer solutions to the sustainability of small and medium enterprises.\nDirector of Unizik Business School, Professor Austin Nonyelu stressed the need to re-jig the informal sector of the economy, which, according to him, play central role in the economic growth of developing countries.\n\u201cGovernment should re-energize the productive sector, sustain livelihood of producers and workers, especially those in lower long of the ladder.\n\u201cBecause of COVID-19, there should be a moratorium on taxation so as to eliminate all the unnecessary charges on small scale producers, retailers and medium-term enterprises for the next one year.

You can find all of our stories here.\nYou can support local journalism by subscribing to The Day.\nThere are numerous testing stations for the coronavirus throughout the region, at hospitals, physicians\u2019 offices, drive-up sites at senior centers and even soup kitchens. But a different type of testing is taking place daily in Norwich and New London, with samples sent to Yale University to try to detect whether a COVID-19 outbreak is coming.\nJordan Peccia, professor of environmental engineering at Yale University, is heading a state-funded study of how the COVID-19 virus detected in raw sewage could help predict whether an infection outbreak can be expected in a certain area. Similar studies across the country have yielded promising results, including one study that was able to detect a pending outbreak in a University of Arizona dormitory before students had shown any symptoms of COVID-19.\nThe Yale study started Aug. 3 and now includes samples from seven sewage treatment plans in Norwich, New London, Hartford, New Haven and Bridgeport. But a preliminary study that started March 13 with the New Haven sewage treatment plant, Peccia said last week, and was able to detect an outbreak in the city in its early stage.\n\u201cIf an outbreak occurs, we may be able to see it early,\u201d Peccia said. \u201cIt will show up in the sewage plant as soon as people start shedding the virus. (COVID-19) testing can be delayed. Reporting of test results can get delayed. We typically can see a signal in the wastewater before you see it in testing.\u201d\nNew London sewage includes flow from parts of Waterford and East Lyme. The Norwich sewage treatment plant serves parts of Franklin, Sprague, Preston, Bozrah and Lisbon.\nPeccia said the Yale study is global for the participating treatment plants, not isolating samples from specific parts of the participating cities and towns, as the Arizona University did by studying sewage flow from individual dorms. He thinks it would be a good idea to isolate certain segments of a city, such as a nursing home or a school.\nLarry Sullivan, Norwich Public Utilities wastewater integrity manager, said at the local sewage treatment plants staff take samples every day and store the small vials of raw sewage in a refrigerated container. On Monday and Thursday mornings, a Norwich sewage plant operator takes that morning\u2019s samples, puts it and the previous few days\u2019 collection of vials into a small, thick foam cooler and drives to the New London plant to pick up its week\u2019s samples. The Norwich operator then drives to the New Haven laboratory, where the samples are tested.\nA team of researchers at the Yale School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, including Ph.D. students and a lab tech overseen by Peccia, analyzes the samples.\nPeccia has been doing research for more than 20 years on environmental pathogens in wastewater and the connection to public health issues. He has researched the possible presence of polio in wastewater and has been finding different strains of coronavirus in wastewater over the years.\nIn addition to early detection of an outbreak, the study also could detect when COVID-19 is declining in an area to help state and local leaders make decisions on reopening businesses, sports, schools and other activities.\nPeccia said it\u2019s important for smaller cities, such as Norwich and New London, to be included because they might not have the infrastructure in place for a major outbreak, and advance notice could help bring in state and federal assistance.\n\u201cIf you have people getting sick in a smaller place, you\u2019re pretty sure to see it in the sludge,\u201d he said.\nPeccia said the $180,000 study, funded by the state Department of Public Health, is scheduled to run through January 2021. No results have been released yet, with the study just ramping up a month into sampling. He said after the analysis, a report will be presented to DPH.\nJoe Lanzafame, head of the New London Department of Public Utilities and Stormwater Authority, said the city received a call from the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection asking if the city was interested in being part of the study.\nLanzafame said the city was \u201cexcited\u201d to join the study at the start, with the first samples taken Aug. 3.\nSullivan said NPU General Manager Chris LaRose learned about the study, reached out and asked to join it, offering to transport Norwich and New London samples to New Haven if the city could be added.\nThe first Norwich samples were taken Aug. 12, \u201cat the tail end\u201d of the COVID-19 outbreak at the Three Rivers Healthcare nursing home on Crouch Avenue, Peccia said.\n\u201cThis is important from a public health standpoint,\u201d NPU spokesman Chris Riley said. \u201cBut it also shows our willingness to participate when we can be of service. This could be enormously helpful to the health of the community.\u201d\nc.bessette@theday.com\nCommenting is closed.

Brett Giroir, the Trump administration's coronavirus testing czar, on Tuesday dismissed the idea of daily Covid-19 tests for all Americans as \"utopian.\"\n\"It's great to talk about this utopian kind of idea where everybody has a test every day and we can do that,\" Giroir said. \"I don't live in a utopian world. I live in the real world, and the real world had no tests for this new disease when this first started.\"\nThe assistant secretary for health at the US Department of Health and Human Services said that the country now has a \"huge diversity\" of tests, including a $5 point of care test that provides results within 15 minutes.\n\"There is no stone unturned, there is no technology that we're not looking at or investing in if it's promising,\" Giroir said. \"We can return to society without having everyone have a test every single day. We can do that. We're showing we can do that.\n\"There may be a time where everybody can wake up in the morning, pass through a tricorder and tell whether they're infected or not,\" Giroir said, referring to the fictional handheld device from \"Star Trek\" that could scan people for data. \"We are not there yet.\"\nTesting availability and speed has improved in the US, particularly since the disastrous spring delays. Giroir said 91.9% of results from major referral labs, which do about half the tests in the US, were completed in three days. The mean turnaround time in August for large referral labs was 2.27 days.\nStill, that 2.27-day average delay allows the virus to quietly spread, and public health and lab industry experts have repeatedly called on the federal government to take a larger leadership role in coordinating testing supplies.\nUS Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, the House majority whip, responded to Giroir's comments by saying, \"It would not be utopian if we had a national program to combat this pandemic. It may be going state by state. But one national program would not be utopian at all.\"\nCNN Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen indicated that Giroir was attacking a straw man. Testing is an important part of public health strategy, but no one seriously argues testing can solve everything alone.\n\"He says, 'People say we can test our way out of the pandemic.' I have never heard anyone seriously say that,\" Cohen said. \"He needs to stop making up these boogie men who he's fighting against. No one is telling him we need a utopia. We're just telling him he needs to do better.\"\nDr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, noted on Twitter that the White House staff has widespread testing, as do sports leagues such as the NFL.\n\"It's not utopia to want to test teachers & kids to return to school, nursing home residents to stay alive, first responders and other essential workers,\" he wrote. \"Sure, lets call it utopia when it's for the less privileged.\"\nDire warnings for Iowa\nA White House coronavirus task force report sent to officials in the state of Iowa this week warned of dire new case increases across rural and urban areas and called for a mask mandate, the closure of bars, and for university towns to do more as the pandemic intensifies in the Midwest.\nCNN has obtained the nine-page August 30 report for the state, first reported by the Des Moines Register, from the Iowa Department of Public Health. The task force releases state-by-state reports each week to governors' offices, and has so far declined to make them publicly available.\nThe report says that Iowa is in the task force-defined \"red zone\" and warns that the state has the highest rate of cases in the US, which increased by 77.4% from the previous week.\nCampus outbreaks\nIn the report, the task force points to universities as a major factor contributing to the virus's spread.\nThe three counties with the highest numbers of cases also have large student populations: Story County, home to Iowa State, and Johnson County, home to University of Iowa, as well as Polk County, which contains Iowa's largest metro area, Des Moines.\nThe university crossed the 1,000 active case mark on August 29 when it reported 302 cases in a single day. The overall current case load, including employees, is 1,026.\nOther schools reported outbreaks.\nAt the University of South Carolina, 1,017 students currently have Covid-19, according to the university's coronavirus dashboard, making it one of the highest case counts recorded at a college so far.\nDespite the climbing active case count and the fact that 60% of the university's designated quarantine space is in use, according to its dashboard, the school still lists its' alert level as \"low.\"\nThe University of Missouri has 424 active student Covid-19 cases, according to the school's Covid-19 dashboard.

The university is at 63% occupancy.\nIt has more students on campus than any other college in the state. By comparison, Rutgers University, has had 101 cases since May 30. That\u2019s in more than three months versus the two-week span during which Rowan cases have spiked. But Rutgers has 1,875 students living on campus. It typically houses 19,000.\nRowan has had 154 active cases of COVID-19 since Aug. 25, a school officials said Wednesday during the virtual meeting. Before the meeting, a school website listed 145 active case, including 100 involving students who live off campus.\nMost of the questions during the meeting were submitted ahead of time and read by Edward Malandro, the township administrator, to a panel of university and municipal officials. Questions mostly centered on who gave permission for the students to return and how are they now being supervised.\n\u201cWe all understand the frustrations you have and on their face the solutions may be simple,\u201d said Jack Manning, the local emergency management coordinator and a township police detective. \u201cBut...they\u2019re not very simple.\u201d\nManning said Rowan appears to be operating within state guidelines for reopening colleges. The state did not set an occupancy guideline for college dormitories. It just said they can\u2019t be at 100%.\nUniversity and municipal officials presented a united front. Both said communications between them have never been better and both sides are working to maintain a safe environment.\n\u201cRowan is part of Glassboro and Glassboro is our home,\u201d said Tony Lowman, the university provost. \u201cWe want to be a good neighbor.\u201d\nUniversity officials said they monitor the health and safety of students and the community daily. They said students who have caught the virus are isolated in a specific dorm on campus until they recover and most have had mild symptoms.\nBut residents pressed for more answers.\n\u201cWith large outbreaks at nearby schools like Temple, why did you feel like bringing kids back to school was the right decision?\u201d Malandro asked the panel, reading a submitted question.\n\u201cWe\u2019re comfortable in our plan,\u201d Lowman said. \u201cWe rely on the data available to us and we work very closely with the state and public health officials to develop this plan.\u201d\nLowman said 80% of class instruction is remote and only about 20% is in person. He and other officials said they are actively engaged with students on and off campus to behave responsibly and university officials and local police have disbanded crowded gatherings.\nRowan is one of about a dozen colleges in New Jersey voluntarily sharing COVID-19 figures publicly. The action is not required by the Office of the Secretary of Higher Education\u2019s 27-page document of standards for colleges to resume, called \u201cThe Road Back.\u201d\nNo other reporting college has nearly the number of cases Rowan has had in such a short time period, though reporting standards and intervals vary widely.\nUniversity and township officials said they plan to continue having virtual meetings to update the public about the spread of virus and what is being done to combat it.\nGlassboro officials said they have closed parks and municipal facilities and modified employee schedules to minimize exposure.\n\u201cWhile this wasn\u2019t unexpected, it is still unnerving,\u201d Manning said.\nStaff writer Allison Pries contributed to this report.\nPlease subscribe now and support the local journalism YOU rely on and trust.\nBill Duhart may be reached at bduhart@njadvancemedia.com.

It\u2019s challenging. It\u2019s not the easy way. It is in fact the hard way, but it\u2019s the right way.\"\nNYC mayor announces most classroom reopening postponed until October\nSept. 17, 202002:13\nOn top of that, the city will address some of the nagging infrastructure problems like poor ventilation in aging school buildings, the mayor and union officials said.\n\u201cThere are some blanks that we need to fill in,\" teachers union leader Michael Mulgrew said at a news conference with de Blasio. \u201cWe must make sure we get this right.\"\nOnly pre-schoolers will be returning to classrooms on Monday, said Mulgrew, whose union represents 133,000 teachers and other education workers.\nKids from kindergarten through eighth grade will return on Sept. 29, while the middle schools and high schools will re-open for in-person learning on Oct. 1.\nSome two weeks ago, de Blasio announced that schools would not reopen on Sept. 10, as the city had planned, after teachers said that there were not enough Covid-19 safeguards in place and threatened to strike.\nDe Blasio\u2019s announcement came as the battle over how best to reopen schools during a pandemic continued to be fought in districts across the country, often pitting teachers against President Donald Trump's administration, which has been pushing hard to get pupils back into classrooms even in states that are still reporting large numbers of new Covid-19 cases.\nIn South Dakota, where 667 infections have been reported among students and staffers since school started, teachers and others told lawmakers Wednesday that containing the coronavirus has been a \u201cnightmare\u201d so far.\nWhile the total number of new cases in South Dakota are down 4.34 percent over the past two weeks, the number of new deaths are up by 64 percent, the latest NBC News figures show. So far, the sparsely populated state has recorded a total of 192 deaths and 17,291 confirmed cases.\nIn Massachusetts, 30 students who attend Attleboro High School were placed in quarantine for two weeks after they came into contact with a classmate who has Covid-19 -- and who was sent to school by parents who knew their son was infected, officials said.\nAttleboro Mayor Paul Heroux said this was \"an egregious violation of the rules.\"\n\"The kid got tested Wednesday, learned he was positive on Friday, and was sent back to school by his parents on Monday,\" Heroux told NBC News. \"The mother claims their doctor told them it was okay for him to go back to school. We're not buying that. The whole world has been dealing with this months and everybody knows you need to quarantine for 14 days.\"\nHeroux said the parents could face civil action from their son's classmates' families.\nMassachusetts, which was a hot spot in the early days of the pandemic, had reported as of Thursday 9,254 deaths and 125,699 confirmed coronavirus cases, according to NBC News numbers.\nMeanwhile, Attorney General William Barr was being lambasted for saying that lockdowns that were put in place to stop the spread of the coronavirus were surpassed only by slavery as the \u201cgreatest intrusion on civil liberties\u201d in the nation\u2019s history.\nRep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., a former civil right activist, called Barr\u2019s remark one of the \u201cmost ridiculous, tone-deaf, God-awful things I have ever heard.\u201d\n\u201cIt is incredible the chief law enforcement officer in this country (would) equate human bondage to expert advice to save lives,\u201d Clyburn, the House majority whip, said on CNN. \u201cSlavery was not about saving lives, it was about devaluing lives. The pandemic is a threat to human life.\u201d\nBarr has been one of the most stalwart defenders of Trump, who has been accused of lying to the American public about the dangers of the pandemic after he was caught on tape in February privately telling journalist Bob Woodward that Covid-19 was \u201cdeadly stuff.\u201d\nTrump has denied lying to the country. But he opposed the lockdowns, was resistant to donning a face mask, and pressured Republican governors to reopen their states just as the crisis was getting worse, sparking a surge in new cases and deaths across the Sun Belt and South that is only now starting to abate.\nThe U.S. is closing in on 200,000 Covid-19 deaths and leads the world with 6.7 million confirmed cases, the NBC News figures show.\nThe U.S. accounts for over a fifth of the world\u2019s 942,076 fatalities and a fifth of the nearly 30 million cases, according to the Johns Hopkins University Covid-19 dashboard.\nIn other coronavirus news:\nThe number of people filing for first-time unemployment benefits ticked down slightly Thursday to around 860,000, according to new data from the federal Department of Labor. Also, the number of continuing claims, which represents people filing for ongoing benefits, fell by almost 1 million, to 12.6 million. But economists found little to cheer about in the new figures. \"Economic hardship continues to occur on a massive scale because coronavirus remains uncurbed,\" said AnnElizabeth Konkel, an economist at Indeed Hiring Lab. \"Overall, a fuller labor market recovery appears to have stalled out. Covid case clusters continue to pop up, and businesses continue to close doors, affecting the livelihood of millions. Until this cycle is broken, a complete economic recovery remains out of reach.\" Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, insisted that the economy was recovering faster than anybody expected and to suggest otherwise was \u201csilly.\u201d\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said there\u2019s no upside to trying to enforce her state\u2019s mask mandate or social distancing requirements at Trump\u2019s campaign rallies. \u201cThe federal guidelines will tell you it\u2019s unsafe to pack people into a venue, without masks where people are projecting their voices,\u201d Whitmer, a Democrat, said. \u201cThat being said, we know that there are First Amendment rights here that are at issue. We also know that the practicalities of going in and enforcing this on candidates probably doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense.\u201d Nevertheless, Whitmer urged the Trump campaign to follow the state rules to keep participants safe. The governor\u2019s remarks came after several thousand Trump supporters flouted safety rules by crowding mask-less into a rally last week in Saginaw, Michigan. Public health officials fear this may have been a \u201csuperspreader\u201d event.\nThirteen U.S. allies think China has done a better job of dealing with the coronavirus than Trump has, a new Pew Research Center survey found. China is where the pandemic is believed to have started. But while Trump continues to refer to Covid-19 as the \u201cChina Virus,\u201d it\u2019s the U.S. that has lost the most prestige on the world stage because of his administration\u2019s botched response to the crisis. \u201cAcross the 13 nations surveyed, a median of just 15% say the U.S. has done a good job of dealing with the outbreak,\u201d the survey found. By contrast, 37 percent said China has done a \u201cgood job\u201d dealing with the crisis.\nBack in April when the pandemic was spreading fast across the Northeast, the U.S. Postal Service \"drafted a news release announcing plans to distribute 650 million masks nationwide, enough to offer five face coverings to every American household,\" The Washington Post reported. The White House \"nixed the plan.\" \"There was concern from some in the White House Domestic Policy Council and the office of the vice president that households receiving masks might create concern or panic,\u201d one administration official told the paper. Instead,the government created Project America Strong which has distributed some 600 million masks to schools, faith-based and other organizations. Dr. Monica Gandhi from the University of California San Francisco told NBC News mailing masks directly to everyone's home would have have driven home the message \"this is so important that we are going to put them in the mail and get them to you.\" Trump and his postmaster Louis DeJoy have been accused of politicizing the USPS and hamstringing its operations to sabotage mail-in balloting. \u201cHow many times has he come out and blatantly said, \u2018Don\u2019t bail out the post office because we don't want them to do mail-in ballots,\u2019\u201d Paul McKenna, president of the Milwaukee area American Postal Workers Union, said last month of Trump. \u201cSo what other conclusion can you have?\u201d _ https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/nyc-delays-reopening-classrooms-again-amid-covid-safety-fears-n1240328 _ NBC News _ 2020-09-17 | Cuomo Issues <b>Outbreak</b> Guidance for Colleges Holding In-Person Classes _ New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has released COVID-19 outbreak guidance for universities and colleges holding in-person classes.\nOn Thursday, Cuomo announced there will be a mandatory transition back to full-time remote learning for any school that hits 100 or more COVID-19 cases or 5% of the campus population, reports Pix 11. Athletics and extracurriculars would also be suspended and dining halls would only offer take-out.\n\u201cWe should anticipate clusters,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cWhen you have large congregations of people, anticipate a cluster. We know that, we expect it, we want to be prepared for it and that\u2019s a threshold that we\u2019re going to put in place.\u201d\nIf the outbreak has not been contained after two weeks, the local health department could require further remote learning or impose \u201cother mitigation measures\u201d in consultation with the State Department of Health.\nNotably, even if there is an outbreak at a college or university that doesn\u2019t reach the threshold, the local department of health or the State Department of Health could still order the school to suspend activities on campus \u201cupon a finding of the college\u2019s inability to control the outbreak.\u201d\nThe day before the governor released his guidance, administrators at New York University (NYU) released a COVID-19 update, stating that \u201cbetween August 1 and August 23, more than 3,000 NYU faculty members, employees and researchers were tested for COVID-19, all of them negative; 7,772 students were tested, too\u2014five of them positive.\u201d\n\u201cWhile these data suggest a low prevalence of COVID-19, newly identified cases among members of the NYU community highlight the importance of NYU\u2019s layered approach to safety and health, which will include robust, mandatory ongoing COVID-19 testing,\u201d the report continues.\nWhile NYU has so far avoided a large outbreak, that isn\u2019t the case for other New York schools that started the semester with some level of in-person learning. SUNY Chancellor Jim Malatras announced a two-week suspension of in-person instruction at the SUNY Oneonta campus after 105 students tested positive.\nThe outbreak occurred after officials received reports of several large student parties, according to Buffalo News. Five students connected with hosting the parties, as well as three campus organizations, were suspended.\nAs a result, on Aug. 30, Cuomo deployed a SWAT team of 71 contact tracers and eight case investigators to help contain the outbreak.\nSpecially trained canine teams are uniquely suited to search for drugs, bombs or other dangerous substances. They can quickly search large areas like schools, sports arenas and hospitals and detect hazards that could not be seen by the human eye.

University of Alabama police have been actively policing students, issuing a total of 203 student non-academic misconduct citations for mask or face covering violations since mid-August. And while a total of 63 face covering citations and 29 occupation violations have been issued by Tuscaloosa police during that same period, the mayor said that doesn\u2019t reflect the actions of most Tuscaloosa residents, business owners and students. \u201cWhat gets lost is the vast majority of citizens, students (and) business owners are all doing the right things to get us out of this sooner,\u201d Maddox said. \u201cIt should make all of us proud that we continue to be a model across the nation.\u201d\nAlaska\nKasigluk: The only store in the village was lost to a fire fought by residents who could not get help from neighboring communities because of a coronavirus lockdown. The store in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta village of Kasigluk burned Sept. 10, leaving residents without a place in town to buy groceries, clothes or other supplies, KYUK-AM reports. The store\u2019s owners are investigating the cause of the fire, Kasigluk Police Chief Brian Noratak said. He said he would normally have called the nearby villages of Nunapitchuk and Atmautluak, but after closing to nonresidents to stem the spread of the coronavirus, he was forced to seek assistance over the radio from the people living in Kasigluk. Noratak asked Atmautluak for extra water hoses, which were delivered by boat, but Kasigluk residents fought the flames, including people who left quarantine to assist. Everything in the store burned, including groceries, electronics and clothes.\nArizona\nPhoenix: At least 11 people infected with COVID-19 traveled to the state and passed the disease to others, starting local transmission chains that seeded Arizona\u2019s earliest coronavirus outbreaks starting in mid-February, according to a newly published paper. Looking at genomes sequenced from virus samples collected in March and early April, researchers found that 80% of the studied genomes stemmed from those 11 people. They likely arrived through domestic travel, but the genomes can ultimately be traced back to virus lineages that circulated heavily in Europe before they came to the United States, the researchers found. Those are among the findings from the first paper published by the Arizona COVID-19 Genomics Union. The researchers found that a person who was isolated in January with COVID-19 after traveling to the epicenter of the outbreak, in China\u2019s Hubei province, did not infect anybody else. \u201cWe were able to determine that public health interventions do work,\u201d said Brendan Larson, a Ph.D. student at University of Arizona who is working on the project.\nArkansas\nLittle Rock: The state on Tuesday surpassed 1,000 total deaths from the illness caused by the coronavirus, including more than 100 newly counted fatalities from probable cases over the past several weeks. The state reported 17 new deaths among confirmed coronavirus cases. The Health Department said it was also adding another 139 deaths from people who tested positive through antigen testing or had COVID-19 listed as a cause of death but did not have lab results confirming it. The latest figures bring Arkansas\u2019 total COVID-19 deaths since the pandemic began in March to 1,149. It\u2019s not clear how far back the probable deaths went, but health officials said they didn\u2019t represent a new increase in COVID-19 fatalities. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned about every death, but I don\u2019t see that (virus deaths are) accelerating,\u201d Gov. Asa Hutchinson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just simply that we are really accounting for deaths that have come in previously.\u201d\nCalifornia\nSan Francisco: A judge on Tuesday ordered classrooms closed at a private school in the Central Valley that has defied state and local health orders aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus. The ruling marked a legal victory for Fresno County health officials, who had unsuccessfully ordered Immanuel Schools last month to stop in-person instruction. The K-12 Christian school, with about 600 students, reopened its campus Aug. 13, saying parents should decide if their children attend school. They also claimed that students had achieved herd immunity, based on a sampling of tests done by a parent who is a pathologist. County health officials had argued that the school was threatening the health and safety of students, faculty and community, and they sued the school seeking a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to bar it from holding in-person classes.\nColorado\nBoulder: All students at the University of Colorado\u2019s main campus are being told to self-quarantine starting Wednesday for the next two weeks to stem an alarming rise in coronavirus cases. The advisory by Jeffrey J. Zayach, executive director of Boulder County Public Health, came in a letter he sent Tuesday to Boulder campus students, faculty and staff. Zayach warned mandatory restrictions could follow if students do not comply. University officials have reported 13 positive tests the first week of school, 90 the second week and 205 the third week. Most cases involve students who live off campus. Students were asked to stay at home with a few exceptions that include attending class or going to work. Dr. Rachel Herlihy, the state epidemiologist, said Tuesday that there have been six COVID-19 outbreaks at Colorado colleges and universities.\nConnecticut\nHartford: The state\u2019s Department of Public Health has decided to close a Norwich nursing home where officials allege violations of COVID-19 protocols have led to several deaths. Acting Commissioner Dr. Deidre Gifford on Monday announced the appointment of a temporary manager to take over operations at the Three Rivers Nursing Home following the investigation of a late July outbreak of COVID-19 in the facility. At least least 21 residents and six staff became infected, and four of those patients have since died. The Health Department determined the facility failed to initially group residents who had tested positive to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 and failed to use personal protective equipment in accordance with federal standards. There were a number of other findings, including failure to maintain a 14-day quarantine for a resident exposed to COVID-19.\nDelaware\nWilmington: The state is experiencing its highest rate of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 since mid-July, which officials attribute to an increase of cases among college students. Gov. John Carney announced Tuesday that the state is seeing a seven-day average of 7.1% for the percent of positive cases, when just weeks ago it was hovering around 4%. Health officials consider the positivity rate a key indicator when looking to further reopen the economy and schools. This is the highest the state\u2019s figure has been since July 12, when the average percent positive was 8.1%. Anything over 5% is considered to be concerning, state officials have said. When looking to allow students fully back into the classroom, the state\u2019s percent positive rate will have to be lower than 3%. \u201cWe really need to do a better job,\u201d Carney said at his weekly press briefing. \u201cIt\u2019s a young adult crowd; it ought to be a responsible crowd.\u201d\nDistrict of Columbia\nWashington: It could be next summer before the bulk of the D.C. region\u2019s workers return to their offices, according to a recent survey by the Greater Washington Partnership. More than six months after the coronavirus pandemic hit the area, forcing thousands to work from home, many employers remain uncertain when and how they will begin allowing employees back in the office, based on the study, WUSA-TV reports. The study, which surveyed more than 400 employers, shows most companies are struggling with how to safely integrate workers back in the office in the midst of the pandemic. While some companies planned to begin bringing workers back after Labor Day this year, they have changed their plans in response to new cases along with employee concerns of contracting the virus while at work, according to the study.\nFlorida\nTallahassee: Nearly 400 additional Florida State University students tested positive for COVID-19 last week, according to an update on the university\u2019s dashboard. The figures show that out of 3,063 tests taken last week, 391 students tested positive, along with six employees. That equates to a 12.9% positivity rate for last week\u2019s test results through Sept. 11, according to the university. Since Aug. 2, FSU\u2019s cumulative positivity rate is 8.49%. The latest figures come as the university begins random COVID-19 testing for asymptomatic students, faculty and staff. It also comes on the heels of social media posts over the weekend deploring the lack of enforcement of mask usage by those attending Saturday\u2019s game against Georgia Tech and images of students attending a crowded gathering at off-campus housing without wearing masks or practicing social distancing.\nGeorgia\nCairo: Grady County has closed its sheriff\u2019s office to outsiders after the 76-year-old sheriff was infected with COVID-19 and hospitalized. The Thomasville Times-Enterprise reports Sheriff Harry Young tested positive for the coronavirus Monday and checked himself into the hospital in Cairo. \u201cMy back was hurting real bad, and I thought that probably was what my problem was,\u201d Young said, saying he\u2019s feeling much better. He expects to be discharged by the end of the week but will spend more time at home in isolation. All other sheriff\u2019s office employees were tested after Young\u2019s diagnosis and found to be negative. Still, officials closed the office to visitors. Deputies will continue to respond to calls, and other business will be handled by phone. Young said deputies were already trying to avoid jailing people, except in the cases of the most serious crimes.\nHawaii\nHilo: A new state program providing $100 million of rental assistance to struggling tenants in the state has received more than 6,000 applications. Hawaii\u2019s Rent Relief and Housing Assistance Program began Sept. 8, The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. The program provides rental assistance to residents having difficulty making payments because of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The program is currently set up to provide assistance for rent payments between Aug. 1 and Dec. 28. Denise Iseri-Matsubara, executive director of the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation, said there have been more than 6,000 applicants and many more inquiries by phone and online. \u201cThe new website has had over 80,000 hits since it was launched,\u201d Iseri-Matsubara said. The program processed some claims and disbursed funds within the first week of its existence.\nIdaho\nBoise: A committee helping to oversee the state\u2019s $1.25 billion share of the federal government\u2019s $2.2 trillion coronavirus rescue package on Tuesday approved spending $150 million to help educate students. The Coronavirus Financial Advisory Committee followed Republican Gov. Brad Little\u2019s request from last week and unanimously approved spending $100 million to replace a similar amount cut by Little in 2020 due to pandemic-related budgetary concerns. The committee also unanimously approved spending $50 million to be made available to parents so they\u2019re less likely to leave the workforce or dip into household money while their children learn amid the challenges posed by the pandemic. That money will be distributed based on income and can be used to purchase educational materials, computers and other services.\nIllinois\nChicago: City officials cautioned residents Tuesday about travel to Wisconsin, citing a recent COVID-19 spike in Illinois\u2019 neighbor to the north. The Chicago Department of Public Health stopped short of adding Wisconsin to its travel advisory list, which includes 16 states. City officials said Chicago residents who travel to the states must quarantine for two weeks upon return to Chicago. Visitors from those states must do the same. Wisconsin was previously on Chicago\u2019s list in late July and then removed the following month when cases dropped. On Sunday, Wisconsin reported its highest one-day case count with 1,582 new confirmed COVID-19 cases and a 21% positive test rate. Its overall seven-day average for positive test that week was 14%. Meanwhile, Illinois reported 1,466 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday and 20 additional deaths. The state\u2019s seven-day average of positive cases is 3.6%.\nIndiana\nIndianapolis: Officials are still holding back on spending more than half of the $2.4 billion state government received in federal coronavirus relief funding. Democrats on the State Budget Committee questioned Tuesday why there wasn\u2019t more urgency in spending the money on the immediate needs of people around the state, while Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb\u2019s top budget adviser blamed some of that on confusion over federal rules. State Office of Management and Budget Director Cristopher Johnston presented a report to committee members showing that only $225 million, or less than 10%, of that money had been spent by the end of August. The report showed nearly $1.1 billion in total had been spent or committed toward programs or expenses related to the COVID-19 pandemic that shut down much of Indiana\u2019s economy through the spring and has killed nearly 3,500 people.\nIowa\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds said Tuesday that she\u2019ll let bars, breweries and taverns in four counties reopen, less than three weeks after she order them closed after a surge in coronavirus cases. In a proclamation effective Wednesday, Reynolds said bars may reopen in Black Hawk, Dallas, Linn and Polk counties. Restaurants in those counties may also resume serving alcohol without the restrictions she implemented Aug. 27. Bars must remain closed in Johnson and Story counties, where the University of Iowa and Iowa State University are located. Restaurants in those counties must still stop selling alcohol at 10 p.m., according to the new proclamation, which will be effective at least until Sept. 20. Those campus areas have continued to have high virus spread rates that Reynolds has attributed to young adults gathering in bars and other locations without masks or adequate distancing.\nKansas\nLawrence: City officials are looking for ways to put the brakes on house parties in neighborhoods near the University of Kansas campus as the number of COVID-19 cases among students continues to rise. After a debate during the Lawrence City Commission meeting Tuesday, a majority of the commissioners said they were interested in at least considering an ordinance that would make it a municipal offense to violate local health orders designed to stem the spread of the coronavirus, the Lawrence Journal-World reports. The discussion came as the the university announced that the total number of COVID-19 cases has risen to 841, an increase of 42 cases since Friday, the paper reports. Multiple house parties also were reported over the weekend. City Attorney Toni Wheeler said the offense would be a misdemeanor that could be prosecuted in municipal court. Violators could face a fine of no more than $500, up to 30 days in jail or both.\nKentucky\nLouisville: Gov. Andy Beshear announced 745 new coronavirus cases Tuesday with nine additional deaths. Though the state\u2019s positivity rate has slipped below 4%, the Democratic governor urged Kentuckians to stay vigilant by wearing a mask and practicing social distancing. He also declared that the last call for bars and restaurants has been extended to 11 p.m., an hour later than previous guidance. This change will allow the businesses to stay open through televised sports games, though they will be required to be closed down by midnight. \u201cFolks, remember that while we have a positivity rate going the right way, we have still a significant number of cases,\u201d Beshear said. \u201cIf we can keep it up, we can do even better.\u201d The positivity rate is an indicator of the extent of the spread of the virus, according to the World Health Organization. If the rate is less than 5% for two weeks, and testing is widespread, the virus is considered under control.\nLouisiana\nBaton Rouge: The Louisiana State University football team had a covert COVID-19 outbreak over the summer. \u201cI think most \u2013 not all of our players \u2013 but most of our players have caught it,\u201d LSU coach Ed Orgeron revealed Tuesday on a teleconference. \u201cSo I think hopefully they don\u2019t catch it again, and hopefully they\u2019re not out for games.\u201d Initially a spike of 30 or more cases was reported in June, and there were a few other cases reported here and there throughout the summer. \u201cTwo weeks ago, everybody on our offensive line except two or three guys were out,\u201d Orgeron said Tuesday. \u201cWe adjusted very well.\u201d Orgeron did not say what led to the outbreak, but LSU had an outbreak of 30 or more football players getting the virus last June after many of the players visited the Tigerland bars near campus.\nMaine\nAugusta: The state\u2019s first jury trial since March has been postponed because the child of a key witness has symptoms consistent with the coronavirus. Maine hasn\u2019t held criminal jury trials in six months due to the pandemic. The judiciary scheduled three trials this month as pilots. Two are in Augusta, and one is in Bangor. The first trial, scheduled to start Tuesday, concerned a defendant charged with misdemeanor operating under the influence. However, a police officer who was a key witness contacted the prosecutor to say his child got sick at day care and needed to be tested for the virus, the Portland Press Herald reports. A judge held a hearing Monday and decided to postpone the trial until the spring. Courts have two other trials scheduled for next week. Maine has had more than 4,900 cases of the virus.\nMaryland\nAnnapolis: Lawmakers and health care advocates proposed increasing the state\u2019s alcohol tax Wednesday to generate millions of dollars to address health disparities, which have been highlighted by the coronavirus pandemic. Supporters are backing a hike in the state\u2019s sales tax on alcohol from 9% to 10% in 2021. Maryland last raised its sales tax on alcohol in 2011. \u201cThe COVID pandemic has made it even more clear that certain communities, especially communities of color, do not have the health care resources they need, which leads to disturbing health disparities,\u201d said Sen. Antonio Hayes, a Baltimore Democrat who is sponsoring the measure in the state Senate. Under the proposal, areas with health disparities would be able to compete for grants and tax incentives. The majority-black Prince George\u2019s County has had more than 28,000 confirmed cases \u2013 the highest number in a Maryland county \u2013 and seen at least 791 deaths.\nMassachusetts\nBoston: Restaurants are now being allowed to offer outdoor dining in public spaces well into the onset of cold weather. The city\u2019s outdoor dining season, designed to boost business during the coronavirus pandemic, had been scheduled to end Oct. 31 but has been extended until Dec. 1, Mayor Marty Walsh announced Tuesday. \u201cRestaurants have faced incredible challenges during this ongoing public health crisis, and the City of Boston is committed to helping them survive and succeed, including by giving restaurants more flexibility around outdoor dining,\u201d Walsh said in a statement. To help keep al fresco diners stay warm as the weather cools, the city will also waive application fees for permits for outdoor propane heaters.\nMichigan\nAllendale: Students at Grand Valley State University were ordered Wednesday to hunker down for two weeks due to a spike in coronavirus cases linked to the western Michigan campus. There have been more than 600 cases of COVID-19 among students since Aug. 23, with the majority among students living off campus, Ottawa County health officials said. The stay-in-place order starts Thursday. Students must stick to their on-campus or off-campus residence unless attending classes, exercising, getting food, seeking health care or working at an essential job. Students cannot return to their home community unless there\u2019s an emergency. \u201cWe need students to take the \u2026 order seriously and be vigilant to help stop the spread of COVID-19,\u201d said Dr. Paul Heidel, the county\u2019s medical director. GVSU athletes can practice sports if a doctor is present, though the health department is \u201cstrongly\u201d discouraging it.\nMinnesota\nMinneapolis: Gov. Tim Walz urged the campaigns of President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden on Tuesday to abide by the state\u2019s guidelines for slowing the spread of the coronavirus when the candidates visit Minnesota on Friday. \u201cPartner with us in the fight against COVID-19,\u201d the Democratic governor said in a letter to both campaigns. Trump may be running as the \u201claw and order\u201d candidate, but that hasn\u2019t stopped him and his campaign from openly defying state emergency orders and flouting his own administration\u2019s guidelines as he holds rallies in battleground states. Trump has an airport rally scheduled for Friday in the north-central Minnesota city of Bemidji. Biden\u2019s campaign has not yet announced a city or venue for his visit. Walz said Minnesota requires face masks inside public places and strongly encourages them for outdoor gatherings.\nMississippi\nCanton: A central Mississippi flea market is scheduled to happen next month, despite a mayor\u2019s attempt to stop it because of COVID-19 safety concerns. The Canton Board of Aldermen voted unanimously Monday to overturn Mayor William Truly\u2019s veto of the Canton Flea Market, WLBT-TV reports. The event is usually held twice a year on the town square in Canton, about 35 miles north of Jackson. Officials canceled the one in May because of the pandemic. The next one is Oct. 8. The flea market typically attracts thousands of shoppers to the small town. Although the event is outside, it\u2019s common to see people crowded close together. Aldermen say they are working on a safety plan that includes requiring all vendors and shoppers to wear masks. They are asking all vendors to have hand sanitizer at each booth, and there are plans for handwashing stations throughout the square.\nMissouri\nColumbia: With more than 1,300 of its students infected with the coronavirus, the University of Missouri said Tuesday that two students were expelled and three others suspended for violating rules meant to slow the virus\u2019s spread. A news release said the sanctions were necessary because of flagrant violations of rules and regulations that require students who test positive for the coronavirus to isolate themselves and comply with social distancing requirements. University System President and MU Chancellor Mun Choi said the university has repeatedly stressed the importance of COVID-19 policies and regulations aimed at keeping students, faculty, staff and the community safe. \u201cWe have seen a strong adoption of our policies and regulations,\u201d Choi said in the release. \u201cUnfortunately, a few students have violated these policies and violated the trust of their fellow community members.\u201d\nMontana\nGreat Falls: The state added 190 cases of COVID-19 early Wednesday, bringing its total to 9,431 confirmations of the respiratory illness. Of the 9,431, 7,186 are recovered, and 2,104 are active, the state said on its covid19.mt.gov website. Montana has tallied 141 deaths, one more than reported Tuesday. The newest death occurred in Gallatin County, state officials said. The state has 106 people hospitalized out of 543 total hospitalizations since the pandemic began. There have been 292,401 tests administered, 2,035 more than Tuesday. Cascade County Sheriff Jesse Slaughter said Sunday that there were 37 new COVID-19 positive cases at the county\u2019s detention center. He said that makes for a total of 60 active inmate cases and 70 inmates who have recovered.\nNebraska\nLincoln: Three more state corrections employees have tested positive for the coronavirus, state prisons officials said over the weekend. An employee at the Nebraska State Penitentiary in Lincoln and two employees at the state Diagnostic and Evaluation Center are the latest to test positive for COVID-19, the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services said in a news release Saturday. With the new cases, a total of 85 state prisons workers across the state have tested positive for the virus. Sixty-three of those have recovered. Officials said anyone who had close contact with the ill employees would be notified and directed to quarantine until they are cleared by a doctor. The agency said on its website that 184 inmates across the state had tested positive for the coronavirus as of Friday. Officials said 126 of those positive cases have been found at the State Penitentiary in Lincoln.\nNevada\nCarson City: Lawmakers allocated $6.2 million in federal relief dollars to a program that will test thousands of teachers across the state as they return to classrooms for in-person instruction. The program will pay for personnel, test kits, test processing and surveillance for up to 62,500 teachers and support staff throughout Nevada. It will be administered by the Clark County Teacher\u2019s Health Trust, the largest public school employee health plan in the state. Throughout the United States, coronavirus cases have spiked in school districts that have opened for in-person instruction, including in Washoe County, where students and teachers at 16 schools in the Reno area have tested positive for the virus since returning to classrooms in mid-August. The district has made free testing available to teachers through the Renown Health hospital network.\nNew Hampshire\nConcord: The Salvation Army is planning to start its Red Kettle campaign earlier this year \u2013 in November \u2013 because of the need caused by the coronavirus pandemic, and people won\u2019t need change or cash in hand to donate. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a code right on the kettle so that people can just take their phone and scan it, so it\u2019s simple and easy,\u201d Rosemarie Dykeman of the Salvation Army of Greater Nashua told WMUR-TV. People also can text \u201cKettles\u201d to 91999 and fill in the amount. The Salvation Army of Northern New England said it could end up serving many more families this Christmas. In 2019, 553 families were served; this year, it estimates the number to be 857 families. \u201cWe\u2019re getting a lot of new families that have lost a job due to the pandemic or the fact that their hours have been cut,\u201d Dykeman said.\nNew Jersey\nMenlo Park: More than 100 veterans, health care workers and relatives of residents who died of COVID-19 rallied outside the state-run veterans home in the city Wednesday, demanding an investigation and the resignation of local managers. Families and union members said management\u2019s orders to stop wearing face masks during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic led the Edison Township facility to amass one of the worst death tolls among nursing homes in New Jersey. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have prevented COVID, but you could have prevented it from becoming a wildfire,\u201d said Shirley Suddoth-Lewis, president of the local chapter of AFSCME, the union representing nurses aides and other workers. Sixty-two residents and one caregiver have died since the start of the pandemic at the 312-bed home. Another state-run veterans center in Paramus leads all nursing homes in the state with 81 residents and one staff member lost.\nNew Mexico\nSanta Fe: A special audit of management contracts is raising concerns about weak financial controls, executive compensation excesses and potential profiteering at a county-owned hospital on the edge of the Navajo Reservation that became overwhelmed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The state auditor\u2019s office on Tuesday released results for the Rehoboth McKinley Christian hospital in Gallup and its management and service contracts dating to 2016. The audit delves into a five-year contract for management of the hospital by the company Healthcare Integrity, whose CEO David Conejo came under criticism in public protests in May as the hospital grappled with coronavirus infections among staff. It resorted to transferring acute COVID-19 patients to other hospitals. Conejo was fired by the hospital in June.\nNew York\nNew York: The city\u2019s already-delayed school year started remotely Wednesday in a soft opening that will serve as a prologue to the return of students to actual classrooms next week. Even as more than a million kids remotely return to class, it\u2019s an open question whether the city can pull off the hybrid learning system Mayor Bill de Blasio announced in July. Unions representing teachers and principals in the nation\u2019s largest public school district say schools still don\u2019t have the teachers or the coronavirus safety measures that are needed, but de Blasio, a Democrat, insisted that the school year would start as planned with three days of online orientation this week. Students began returning to physical classrooms Wednesday for the first time since March. New York City is one of only a few large U.S. cities attempting to start the school year with students in real classrooms.\nNorth Carolina\nRaleigh: The state government is using federal COVID-19 relief dollars to purchase equipment so more public school students can access online classes and homework help. Gov. Roy Cooper announced last week that nearly $40 million would go toward funding a new partnership involving his administration. The project, called NC Student Connect, is designed to improve reliable internet for children as they learn remotely this fall due to coronavirus restrictions. About $30 million will go toward the purchase and distribution of 100,000 wireless, high-speed hot spots for students, Cooper\u2019s office said in a news release. Another $8 million will provide free high-speed internet in public locations like parking lots so students can drop by to download class lessons. Other money will help instruct teachers, parents and students about remote learning techniques.\nNorth Dakota\nBismarck: State health officials on Wednesday reported 269 new COVID-19 cases and five more deaths related to the coronavirus, including two in Burleigh County and two in Eddy County. The other death was in McLean County. The state has recorded 172 deaths since the pandemic began, which is the 46th-most in the country overall and the 37th-highest per capita, according to the COVID Tracking Project. But the volunteer organization ranks North Dakota No. 1 overall in the number of cases per capita in the past two weeks. Officials confirmed cases in 35 counties in the last day, led by Cass County with 80, Williams County with 49, Burleigh County with 17 and Ward County with 13. There were no other counties with cases in double figures. The number of active cases in the state dropped by 36, to 2,528. The number of hospitalizations remained unchanged at 62.\nOhio\nColumbus: The state will be able to hire a health director despite concerns about criticism a candidate might face, Gov. Mike DeWine said Tuesday, addressing last week\u2019s turn of events during which his new director withdrew her name just five hours after it was announced. DeWine said he respected the decision by former South Carolina Health Director Dr. Joan Duwve to reject the job Sept. 10. She cited unspecified personal reasons, then issued a statement the next day saying she learned the previous health director\u2019s family had been harassed by the public. Dr. Amy Acton abruptly resigned as health director in June following a torrent of conservative criticism over her public health orders to slow the spread of the pandemic. That included armed protesters outside her house and protests outside the Ohio Statehouse with signs bearing anti-Semitic messages. Acton is Jewish.\nOklahoma\nOklahoma City: The city\u2019s children will return to the classroom part time in mid-October or early November, depending on their grade, under a plan adopted by the school board in the state\u2019s largest district. Under the plan agreed to Tuesday night, pre-K and kindergarten students will get two days per week of in-person instruction and three days of virtual classes starting Oct. 19. \u201cThese children are least familiar with a school setting and have some of the greatest challenges in a virtual setting, so this plan will give them a chance to acclimate before the rest of the students arrive,\u201d Superintendent Sean McCasland said in a statement. Half of the students will attend in-person classes on Mondays and Tuesdays, and the other half will do so on Thursdays and Fridays. All students will receive remote instruction on Wednesdays. Students will have their temperatures checked each day and be encouraged to wear masks.\nOregon\nSalem: On the eve of the first day of school, parents and educators reported districtwide technical issues with some of Salem-Keizer Public Schools\u2019 new remote learning platforms. Class rosters were not loading Wednesday, and some students still didn\u2019t have login credentials. Educators were still receiving training on how to run the systems. and crafting curricula. Some still didn\u2019t know which classes or grades they will teach. Parents were still attempting to set up the new apps, secure needed technology and reassure their children. With the COVID-19 pandemic and Oregon wildfires in the background, families and educators in Salem-Keizer schools are beginning the new year amid confusion, chaos and, for some, traumatic loss. Wednesday ran on a modified schedule, similar to a soft opening, with all students but kindergarteners expected to start their full-day schedule Thursday.\nPennsylvania\nHarrisburg: The state House on Tuesday passed a bill that would prevent governors from applying their disease control powers to shut down gatherings at churches or other houses of worship. The chamber voted 149 to 53 for the proposal, which the Democratic leader called a solution in search of a problem. All Republicans voted for it, while Democrats were split fairly evenly. \u201cThere\u2019s never been a closure, and there won\u2019t be,\u201d Minority Leader Frank Dermody, D-Allegheny, said during floor debate. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf and authorities under him have not restricted religious gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic. Instead, he asked religious leaders to protect their congregants. Wolf\u2019s stay-at-home order effectively exempted religious activity but strongly discouraged gatherings. The proposal was sent to the Senate for its consideration.\nRhode Island\nProvidence: Providence College students who live off campus have been asked to stick to remote-only classes for the time being after several tested positive for COVID-19, school officials say. Off-campus students are only allowed to visit campus for testing, the school said Tuesday. \u201cWe have received reports of students who have tested for COVID-19 tests on their own, at off-campus facilities. Some of these results have been reported to the college by the Rhode Island Department of Health; others have been self-reported,\u201d Steven Sears, interim vice president for student affairs and dean of students, said in a message to off-campus students. Off-campus students must learn remotely until they can produce a negative test result, he said. The school said as of Tuesday, 22 students and one faculty member or staffer had tested positive for the disease.\nSouth Carolina\nColumbia: The state Senate passed changes Tuesday to the budget that would provide a small raise to most teachers and a hazard pay bonus for some lower-paid state workers. Now attention turns to the House, where leaders may prefer not to change the $9 billion budget at all with worries that COVID-19 could continue to hobble the economy and cut state revenues. Lawmakers have already agreed to keep spending levels for the budget year that started in July at the same levels as the year before. The Senate also approved how it thinks South Carolina should spend the remaining $668 million in federal money for COVID-19 expenses, including setting aside $425 million toward repaying the fund that doles out unemployment benefits. The state has already set aside $500 million in federal money to replenish that fund.\nSouth Dakota\nSioux Falls: Eight additional people with COVID-19 have died, the state Department of Health reported Wednesday \u2013 a single-day record that brought the death toll from the coronavirus to 192. South Dakota also reported its single largest day of test results. The 5,690 results detected 297 new infections, for a daily positive rate of 5.22%. The total number of South Dakotans reported with the disease was 17,291. Sixty-eight of the new cases were in the higher-risk population of people older than 60. Fifty-four were among those 20-29, while 40 were in those 10-19. The age group with the smallest number of infections was 0-9, with eight positive cases.\nTennessee\nNashville: The nearly decadelong climb of the state\u2019s graduate rate lost ground during the 2019-20 school year amid a turbulent school year thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic. About 89.6% of public high school seniors earned their diplomas at the end of the 2019-20 school year, a slight dip from the 89.7% rate set during the 2018-19 school year. Though the rate is down by one-tenth of a percentage point this year, the state has seen a steady increase since changes were made in 2011. Education Commissioner Penny Schwinn lauded last year\u2019s record-high rate set by the Class of 2019 and said at the time she believed the state could top results. With most schools across the state closing by April because of the pandemic, many high school seniors missed the last months of the school year, but the state relaxed graduation requirements to ensure seniors weren\u2019t negatively affected by the sudden disruption to the school year.\nTexas\nDallas: State health officials on Tuesday reported 4,816 new cases of the coronavirus and 132 additional deaths. The total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state is now 668,746, while the death toll stands at 14,343, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. The true number of cases in Texas is likely higher, though, because many people haven\u2019t been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. Health officials estimate nearly 68,500 cases in the state are active. There were about 3,300 people with COVID-19 hospitalized in Texas on Tuesday, health officials said. The number of hospitalizations has been decreasing since peaking July 22 at 10,893.\nUtah\nSalt Lake City: State officials say the U.S. Postal Service has sent erroneous information to voters about the upcoming election, decreasing public confidence in the service\u2019s ability to handle ballots this year. The office of Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox said the Postal Service mailed a postcard to homes across the state last week urging voters \u201cto request your mail-in ballot \u2026 at least 15 days before Election Day,\u201d The Salt Lake Tribune reports. \u201cAll active registered voters in Utah automatically receive their ballots in the mail. Individuals do not need to request a mail-in ballot separately if they have previously registered to vote,\u201d Cox said, arguing that the postcard\u2019s information did not apply in Utah. State officials have encouraged methods other than voting on Election Day to reduce crowds and limit the risk of spreading COVID-19.\nVermont\nSt. Johnsbury: The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted the town to cancel its annual Halloween parade. Organizer Diane Cummings told the town select board Monday that the parade brings at least 3,000 people onto the streets of the community. The Caledonian Record reports she said the committee plans to let people know about the cancellation. \u201cWe were thinking of hanging skeletons along Main Street \u2013 maybe a dozen holding signs saying something like \u2018Boo-Hoo, No Parade This Year\u2019 or something corny like that,\u201d she said. But Cummings said the committee is still determined to do something special for Halloween. One idea is to provide Halloween candy to children through the St. Johnsbury schools. All pandemic precautions would be followed while the candy is prepared for distribution, Cummings said. Other ideas the committee is working on include a pumpkin carving and scarecrow competitions.\nVirginia\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam is trying to reassure Virginians that voting by mail is safe and that election security is a top priority for the state. The Democratic governor made the comments Tuesday while highlighting steps the state is taking to protect absentee voting during the coronavirus pandemic, which include using drop boxes for early voting and putting barcodes on absentee ballot envelopes to track when they are delivered. \u201cWe all share the priority of ensuring free and fair elections,\u201d Northam said. Virginia is one of several states offering ways for voters to verify the status of their ballot online. The Virginia Department of Elections\u2019 citizen portal shows when an absentee ballot request has been received, when a ballot has been sent and when the ballot has been received by a local election office. Lawmakers also recently approved Northam\u2019s proposal to spend $2 million for prepaid postage for all absentee ballots.\nWashington\nMount Vernon: The Skagit County Department of Emergency Management in northwest Washington state has provided about 2,000 N95 masks to protect agricultural workers amid the widespread wildfires, officials said. Thick smoke has made the air quality unhealthy and prompted orders for citizens to stay home as much as possible. The smoke is expected to linger until at least Thursday, the Skagit Valley Herald reports, but area farmers cannot halt all of their outdoor work. Farmers and farmworkers were already required to wear face coverings because of the coronavirus, but cloth masks do little to protect from wildfire pollutants, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Masks like the N95 can protect against harmful particles found in smoke.\nWest Virginia\nCharleston: State officials yet again amended guidelines for reopening schools Tuesday, with the aim of restarting in-person instruction and sports in more counties. The changes add a new category to the state\u2019s color-coded coronavirus map, which rates the severity of the outbreak in counties. Critics and education groups say multiple tweaks to the map over several weeks have confused parents and school officials. Republican Gov. Jim Justice and his advisers unveiled the new gold category after an hourslong meeting Monday evening. Five counties can now resume in-person instruction and sports competitions after moving from orange to gold. The West Virginia Education Association, which has about 15,000 members, slammed the rollout. \u201cWe are angry that our state leaders continue to manipulate the color-coded map,\u201d Dale Lee, president of the association, said in a statement.\nWisconsin\nMadison: University of Wisconsin-Madison officials made the right decision to reopen the campus even though there\u2019s been a surge of COVID-19 cases there, Gov. Tony Evers said Tuesday. The state\u2019s flagship university reopened Sept. 2. As of Tuesday, 2,160 students and 31 university workers have tested positive for COVID-19. The university has been forced to suspend in-person classes in lieu of online instruction and quarantine multiple fraternity and sorority houses as well as two large dorms. Chancellor Rebecca Blank, who has blamed the outbreak on student actions, has been intensely criticized for opening the campus for the fall semester after other colleges across the country that opened earlier saw similar outbreaks. Evers, a Democrat, defended the decision, saying the reopening came with a massive effort to test students and trace infected students\u2019 contacts. Students should take more responsibility for their behavior, he said.\nWyoming\nCheyenne: About 100 students at a junior high school have been told to stay home after a school employee tested positive for the coronavirus. The positive case at McCormick Junior High School announced Tuesday was the first in the Cheyenne-area school district since school began Aug. 31. School officials were ready to offer remote instruction for students who needed it, Laramie County School District No. 1 Superintendent Boyd Brown told the Wyoming Tribune Eagle.

Thousands of cases have been reported nationwide, forcing universities to switch to virtual classes and either quarantine or, in some cases, send students back home whether or not they're sick.\nThe situation has become serious enough that Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, is urging colleges: If at all possible, do not send students home.\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\"It's the worst thing you could do,\" he said Wednesday on NBC's \"TODAY\" show. \"When you send them home, particularly when you're dealing with a university where people come from multiple different locations, you could be seeding the different places with infection,\" said Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\nDr. Anthony Fauci predicts \u2018safe and effective vaccine\u2019 by end of 2020\nSept. 2, 202002:05\nOn Monday, Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, cautioned governors on a call that college students could become a source of outbreaks beyond campuses.\n\"Sending these individuals back home in their asymptomatic state to spread the virus in their hometown or among their vulnerable households could really re-create what we experienced over the June time frame in the South,\" Birx said, according to a source on the call.\nNationally, two of the biggest outbreaks have occurred in Iowa, in the counties home to the largest universities in the state: Iowa State University and the University of Iowa.\nIowa State reported a spike in cases the second week of school, with a 28.8 percent positivity rate among students tested for COVID-19. And according to the University of Iowa's COVID-19 dashboard, nearly 1,000 students have tested positive within the past two weeks.\nBoth colleges are still holding some in-person classes, usually as long as they do not exceed 50 students.\nWednesday, a group of students and faculty members at the University of Iowa planned a \"sickout\" in a show of solidarity over concerns about \"the rampant spread of COVID-19\" on campus.\n\"As students and educators, we have seen firsthand that there is no safe way to hold classes in person during this pandemic,\" the group wrote online.\nAt James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia,more than 400 cases of the coronavirus were reported less than a week after school started. University President Jonathan Alger announced plans to shift temporarily to online courses primarily and asked most students to leave campus by next Monday.The University of Notre Dame in Indiana has nearly 600 cases. Classes there switched to online only for two weeks, and the university is resuming in-person learning. Many students at North Carolina State University in Raleigh must move off campus this week.\nClusters were not unexpected. Put people in their late teens and early 20s into close quarters in dormitories and contagious illnesses are bound to spread, experts said.\n\"The college housing experience was not built for plagues,\" said Art Caplan, a professor of bioethics at NYU Langone Health. \"They're going to wander. They're going to visit each other. They're going to go into town. They're going to sneak off and have a party. This is what they do.\"\nWhat universities do next is critical, according to experts \u2014 their decisions could stop the spread of COVID-19, or keep it going.\n\"Some colleges have the capability of a dorm or a couple of floors of a dorm where they could keep people who are infected,\" Fauci said. \"Keep them at the university in a place that's sequestered enough from the other students so that you don't get a cluster in the university, but don't have them go home, because they could be spreading it in their home state.\"\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\nMany colleges have come up with plans to isolate sick students, with designated areas on campus for infected students who are not sick enough to be hospitalized.\nThe University of Wisconsin-Madison has set aside such housing for sick students to keep them in Madison. \"The concern about sending all these college kids back home is that we potentially increase transmission in many communities,\" said Dr. Jeff Pothof, an emergency medicine physician who is the university's chief quality officer.\nIndeed, sending all students off campus \u2014 not just those confirmed to be infected \u2014 carries the risk of sending asymptomatic students home, where they could expose vulnerable family members.\n\"You potentially have a ton of people who don't even know they have disease,\" said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and an infectious disease physician at the Massachusetts General Hospital. \"Five days later, they're going to come down with symptoms \u2014 or maybe even not \u2014 and now they're living with their parents.\"\nIt's been established that older adults and people with underlying health problems are at greater risk for more severe forms of the coronavirus, compared to children and younger adults.\nCaplan suggests a different approach, at least when it comes to infected students.\n\"I think sending them home is better,\" he said, explaining that students' movements may be easier to control at home and that they may have better access to medical care depending on where they live.\nWhat's more, keeping students on campus increases risks to instructors, cafeteria workers and other support staff members, even people who deliver food to the dorms.\nCaplan acknowledges that it is a complex situation, without a single answer for all universities.\nNorth Carolina State freshman Kathryn Livoti is preparing to move home Saturday, even though she has been doing everything possible to reduce her risk for COVID-19.\n\"We just do homework all the time. It's pretty much all we do,\" said Livoti, 18. \"I don't want to blame people who want to go out, because I want to, too.

To comply with social distancing guidelines, parties or large gatherings are forbidden.\nBut, just a few weeks into the fall semester, the experiment is faltering. Colleges and universities across the country are struggling to contain surges of COVID-19 cases on campus. As of Tuesday, more than 25,000 students and campus staff in at least 37 states had tested positive for the virus\u2014mostly concentrated in southern states that were already struggling to contain a COVID-19 crisis.\nThe numbers are expected to increase as more colleges prepare to open their doors after Labor Day.\n\u201cThe University of South Carolina is a large university but, compared to other schools opening up after Labor Day, our cases will be a drop in the bucket,\u201d Dr. Helmut Albrecht, chairman of the Department of Internal Medicine at the University of South Carolina in Columbia and Prisma Health, told The Daily Beast. \u201cWe\u2019re worried but we\u2019re managing. Other universities should be scared.\u201d\nOn Thursday, the University of South Carolina recorded 1,026 positive coronavirus tests among their 35,000 student body, and in the past week they had a test positivity rate among students and faculty of 26.3 percent.\nAdministrators at the southern school are finally cracking down after becoming one of the hardest-hit campuses in the nation following a slew of large parties, including one crowded pool party over the weekend shut down by the fire department.\nOn Monday, the school announced that 15 students had been placed under interim suspension and six Greek organizations had been charged with student conduct violations after hosting parties.\nIn addition, the school placed three Greek Village houses in quarantine after residents tested positive, bringing the total number in quarantine to nine houses\u2014or nearly half of the school\u2019s fraternity and sorority chapter houses.\n\u201cOur total number of active cases is larger than we expected at this point, and some student behavior off-campus is both disappointing and unacceptable,\u201d Bob Caslen, the university\u2019s president, said in a Tuesday letter to the university. \u201cWe are confronting these realities and taking action.\u201d\nThe disciplinary action came days after hundreds of mask-less students were seen at a pool party near campus that defied the city\u2019s mask ordinance and social distancing mandates. As one of the earliest states to loosen coronavirus restrictions, South Carolina is still struggling to contain COVID-19, with a death toll of 2,652 and a current positivity rate of almost 20 percent.\nFire Chief Aubrey Jenkins told The State on Saturday that, as he was breaking up the massive pool party, one person told him, \u201cI can\u2019t catch COVID. I\u2019m immune to the stuff.\u201d\n\u201cIt was almost like Mardi Gras,\u201d Jenkins told the newspaper. \u201cI saw a large crowd in the pool, in the area on the side of the pool, and on top of the pool house.\u201d He said no fines were issued.\nDespite the uptick in coronavirus cases at USC, Albrecht said administrators have been preparing for possible outbreaks for five months and knew that bringing students back \u201cwas an uphill battle.\u201d He stressed that the influx of positive tests has \u201ca lot of positive consequences\u201d for the community because it helps curtail the spread into the general public. However, university officials say that about 90 percent of cases are among students and that the spread is not occurring in classrooms\u2014but off-campus.\n\u201cWe expected a lot of positives,\u201d Albrecht said, adding that the best approach was to test widely rather than close down the school, which would only further harm the community. \u201cWe were hoping for slightly less and we were hoping we would not see pool parties and that kind of stuff, but, in all honesty, this is part of their lifestyle\u2014this is why you go to college. We are not happy about it but we are managing.\u201d\nThousands of miles away at Indiana University, 75 percent of the school\u2019s Greek houses are now under quarantine\u2014and officials on Thursday said they wanted all fraternity and sorority houses shut down on its Bloomington campus.\nCiting \u201can increasingly alarming\u201d rate of positive test results\u2014including a staggering 50 percent positive testing rate in some houses\u2014officials said they now \u201cbelieve Greek houses are not safe given the pandemic conditions and the current spread of COVID-19.\u201d\n\u201cGiven the Greek housing structure, avoiding close contact with residents who may carry the virus is virtually impossible,\u201d the university tweeted. \u201cDorms are not seeing the level of positivity rates that are being found in Greek houses.\u201d\nThere are 2,600 students in 42 communal living houses at IU, a university spokesman told The Daily Beast, including 40 fraternity and sorority houses, in which 30 are currently under quarantine.\nOhio State officials are also struggling to contain the virus after cases jumped by nearly 400 since last week. To date, 882 students have tested positive, with an overall positive rate of 3.13 percent. That statistic, however, jumps to 5.7 percent among on-campus students and 10 percent for those living off-campus, according to data released on Monday.\nThe school has already suspended 228 students for violating coronavirus-related safety guidelines and has threatened to crack down on gatherings of more than 10 people.\nThere have also been large outbreaks at Iowa State and the University of Iowa\u2014a state now recording the largest increase in COVID-19 cases in the nation.\n\u201cI am confident that by strictly following [university] guidelines we can drive this positivity rate down,\u201d Kristina M. Johnson, the Ohio State University president, said in a Wednesday email to the school, admitting that off-campus rates are not \u201cencouraging.\u201d \u201cWe need your focused attention to move in that direction and keep each other, our families, and all Ohioans safe and healthy.\u201d\nBut while some colleges have become overwhelmed by new cases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has urged universities not to send students home because it risks furthering the spread. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Notre Dame have followed this advice and reverted to online learning while still housing students on campus after more than 100 students tested positive.\nSUNY Oneonta on Thursday said the school would close and switch to fully remote learning for the rest of the semester after 389 people tested positive for COVID-19. \u201cAlthough this situation is unsettling, I must ask for patience and cooperation from students and families as we work to help students get home to resume remote learning as safely and quickly as possible,\u201d President Barbara Jean Morris said in a letter sent to the campus community.\nTemple University also suspended most of their in-person classes on Thursday after the Philadelphia school reported more than 200 COVID-19 cases just two weeks into the fall semester.\n\u201cIt's the worst thing you could do,\u201d Fauci said Wednesday on NBC\u2019s Today show. \u201cWhen you send them home, particularly when you're dealing with a university where people come from multiple different locations, you could be seeding the different places with infection.\u201d _ https://www.thedailybeast.com/coronavirus-is-swamping-university-and-college-campuses-weeks-after-reopening _ The Daily Beast _ 2020-09-03 | Two Illinois moms moved their daughters back to <b>University</b> of Iowa.

They\u2019re still a little tired and worried about what the future holds, but they\u2019re relieved that their brush with COVID-19 wasn\u2019t any worse.\n\u201cLuckily, when I came back from taking Kate, three of my other kids were at their dad\u2019s,\u201d Iasparro said. \u201cWhen Kate starting showing symptoms the next day, I quarantined and they just stayed with their dad.\u201d\nThen, after Iasparro fell ill, her husband tested negative, she said, and the couple\u2019s two daughters, ages 3 and 5, have showed no symptoms.\nThe Minnaerts quarantined immediately after Sheley\u2019s diagnosis, as well, and other family members have tested negative.\n\u201cThis was solely from Jessica and I moving our daughters in. We didn\u2019t go out to dinner. We did nothing else,\u201d Minnaert said. \u201cKate tested positive on the 21st. Gillian tested positive on the 23rd, and then I started feeling sick on Sunday and tested positive on Tuesday.

They didn\u2019t go out. They didn\u2019t go to crowded bars or restaurants or attend parties, although that kind of activity was going on all around them.\nSweeney said she stayed in a tightknit circle of friends and stayed home, but it didn\u2019t matter. Everyone in the group tested positive for COVID-19 in a matter of days.\nSweeney ended up returning to Rockford to quarantine and recover with her mom and has since returned to Iowa City.\n\u201cI was really sick day one and then, day two and three, I just had really bad body aches,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cOn day four, I lost my sense of taste and smell \u2014 that was horrible.

Those clarifications have been noted in italic and added to the original story below.\nMUNCIE, Ind. (AP) \u2014 Within five weeks after students started returning to Ball State University last month, the surrounding county had become Indiana\u2019s coronavirus epicenter.\nOut of 610 symptomatic students tested for the virus through IU Health, more than half have been positive. Dozens of infections have been blamed on off-campus parties, prompting university officials to admonish students.\nUniversity President Geoffrey Mearns wrote that the cases apparently were tied not to classrooms or dormitories but to \u201cpoor personal choices some students are making, primarily off campus.\u201d\n\u201cThe actions of these students are putting our planned on-campus instruction and activities at risk,\u201d he said.\nSimilar examples abound in other college towns across the nation. Among the 50 U.S. counties with the highest concentrations of students and overall populations of at least 50,000, 20 have consistently reported higher rates of new virus cases than their states have since Sept. 1, according to an Associated Press analysis.\nOn average, infection rates in those 20 counties have been more than three times higher than their states\u2019 overall rates.\nAt James Madison University in Virginia, which recently sent students home through September amid a surge in cases, the county is averaging a weekly infection rate of nearly 90 cases per 100,000 people, or more than eight times the statewide average.\nHealth officials fear that surges among college students will spread to more vulnerable people \u2014 older ones and those with underlying health problems \u2014 and trigger a new wave of cases and hospitalizations. Some worry that colleges could overwhelm hospitals already bracing for increasing cases of COVID-19 and flu this fall and winter.\n\u201cThere\u2019s this waiting game. Does it stay on college campuses or will it escape?\u201d said Dr. Jeff Pothof, chief quality officer at the University of Wisconsin medical center in Madison, where cases among college students have been climbing.\nWhile universities have emerged as hot spots in nearly every state, many of the worst outbreaks have been scattered across the South and Midwest. Of the 50 college counties analyzed by the AP, James Madison\u2019s had the highest infection rate, followed by counties that are home to the University of Georgia, Florida State and Indiana University in Bloomington.\nIn the 10 counties with the highest infection rates, colleges have reported at least 15,000 cases among students and employees in recent weeks, though testing and reporting practices vary significantly and the actual number is probably much higher.\nFor many colleges, the return to campus was a carefully orchestrated process that took months to plan and millions of dollars to pull off. But as safe as they\u2019ve made their campuses, many colleges have struggled to curb off-campus gatherings that have been tied to thousands of infections.\nParties were blamed for dozens of cases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which brought students back in early August only to send them home weeks later.\nOther schools have cracked down on parties and disciplined students. The University of Missouri in Columbia announced this week that it expelled two students and suspended three others for violating rules meant to slow the virus\u2019s spread.\nThe outbreaks are increasingly straining relations between universities and their towns.\nAmid a spike in cases at the University of Colorado at Boulder, county health authorities Tuesday urged all students to quarantine for two weeks. Students and others at the university have accounted for 76% of the county\u2019s 663 positive cases over the past two weeks, officials said.\n\u201cMore stringent and mandatory restrictions will be imposed if students do not comply and break the transmission cycle,\u201d Jeffrey Zayach, executive director of Boulder County Public Health, warned in a letter to students.\nIn a letter to students, the school\u2019s chancellor, Philip DiStefano, warned that the quarantine will be strictly enforced and that students who violate it could face suspension or other discipline. Already, DiStefano said, more than 400 students face university discipline for violating public health orders.\nAt Miami University in Ohio, county health authorities ordered all of the school\u2019s athletes to isolate for 14 days last month after 27 tested positive for the virus. Last week, local police cited six men at an off-campus house party that included several students who had recently tested positive.\nAs cases increase at Boston College and the campus runs out of quarantine space, the mayor of nearby Newton is asking the school not to use any of the town\u2019s hotels or other property to isolate students.\nSome cities have tightened rules at bars to discourage students from gathering. As cases surged at Illinois State, the town\u2019s mayor issued an order requiring all bar customers to be seated to be served. He also limited gatherings near campus to no more than 10 people.\nStill, residents and officials in many college towns are rooting for universities to work through outbreaks and avoid campus closings that could further hurt the local economy.\nFred Pryce, who manages a series of stores in a strip mall near Ball State, said sending students home would hurt the area\u2019s businesses \u201cbig time.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s 20,000-plus potential patrons that will vanish,\u201d Pryce said. \u201cThere are ways to keep students in Muncie safely while they do their classes.\u201d\nBall State, roughly 60 miles from Indianapolis, has 21,600 students on a campus of red brick buildings and sleek, modern dorms in Muncie, where the university is the city\u2019s second-largest employer after Ball Memorial Hospital.\nOn campus last week, sophomore La\u2019Tricia Williams, wearing a mask, said she was glad to be back instead of sitting on the couch with her laptop at her family\u2019s home, taking online classes.\n\u201cBut I get that it comes with some risk,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can give students a whole bunch of rules for what they should and shouldn\u2019t do while they\u2019re back at the school, but they\u2019re not going to stop doing certain things here or going out into the community.\u201d\nCaleb Henry, a Ball State junior who lives off campus, said that he and other students have been frequenting local bars and meeting at friends\u2019 houses but that he and most others are behaving responsibly, with masks and social distancing. He said students are being vilified unfairly.\n\u201cEveryone seems to be getting upset at college kids right now, accusing us of spreading the virus and making us out to be these highly infectious creatures that need to be sent home,\u201d Henry said. \u201cWhat about all the other people around town going to bars \u2026 having parties, weddings, whatever? We\u2019re only doing the same things they are.\u201d\nAs cases mounted at Ball State last month, the school tried to ban students from visiting dorms other than their own, but officials reversed the rule after a backlash from students. Even so, officials say infection rates have started to subside, and the school has contingency plans for changing from in-person to totally online.\nWhile some colleges have sent students home amid outbreaks, many others are digging in. Some have moved classes online but urged students to stay where they are until cases drop. Among them is the University of Notre Dame, which paused in-person classes Aug. 18 and moved them online amid a surge that saw as many as 89 new cases per day. Weeks later, after a sharp decrease in infections, classes have started to resume on campus.\nOther schools are hoping to replicate that success, including the University of Illinois, the University of Wisconsin and West Virginia University, which recently shifted classes online as the virus spread.\nIn a recent call with governors, Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, cautioned against sending students home, saying that could spark outbreaks elsewhere.\nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos has also endorsed Notre Dame\u2019s approach, saying colleges that \u201cwork through it\u201d and find ways to isolate infected students are more likely to \u201cend up in the best place.\u201d\nIn a letter to students at Ball State this week, the university president thanked students for helping reduce virus rates. Still, he warned: \u201cThis data is not a cause for celebration. Rather, this data is a call for continued action.\u201d _ https://fox59.com/news/coronavirus/as-students-returned-to-ball-state-university-covid-19-infections-soared-in-delaware-county/ _ FOX59 News _ 2020-09-18 | "}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-81.24263, 41.10403]}, "properties": {"weight": 6.079441541679836, "name": "Northeast Ohio Medical University", "descriptions": "What will we know about students, staff infected with <b>COVID-19</b> as Ohio schools reopen? _ Akron Beacon Journal\nSocial media posts are churning across the state as Ohio schools reopen amid the pandemic:\nA football coach is hospitalized with COVID-19 and his team is quarantined.\nA student with no symptoms infected his classmates.\nA handful of teachers tested positive before in-person school even began.\nMany Ohio schools have refused to either knockdown or substantiate the rumors, citing privacy concerns. And that\u2019s caused frustration and fear among many parents and teachers already uneasy about sending children back to class.\nLast Thursday, Gov. Mike DeWine seemed to offer a potential solution: He said the state will soon require that each Ohio school publicly report COVID-19 cases among students and staff within 48 hours of learning of a case.\nBut just how much information will be released and how helpful it will be for parents making tough choices about their family\u2019s safety is not yet clear.\nNeither the Ohio Department of Health nor the Ohio Department of Education answered questions submitted by a reporter last Thursday. Representatives for both departments referred the reporter to the order, which will not be available until this week.\nWhat can schools release?\nBalancing privacy against the public\u2019s right to know can be complicated.\nA federal law prohibits the disclosure of personal medical records by health providers, but the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) doesn\u2019t extend to schools. Another federal law governs educational privacy; yet the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) allows the release of case information, as long as people, including students, are not named.\nBut some public officials say that it isn't names alone hat identify individuals.\nThe Warren County Health Department emphasized the issue of inadvertently publicly identifying schoolchildren or employees even without releasing their names: \"When there are small numbers of cases, a small number of total students (and) employees within a small population \u2013 schools \u2013 reporting specific numbers could disclose the identity of the cases which is against HIPAA law,\" a statement released by Health Commissioner Duane Stansbury says.\nGiving out too many details can identify a child even if a district doesn\u2019t release a name, said Jarrod Tudor, director of regional campuses and education at the University of Akron.\n\u201cWe have a 9 year-old son ... one kid in a district,\u201d Tudor said. \u201cBut if we say one boy in Mrs. Turner\u2019s class, you\u2019ve narrowed it down to nobody else but him if my son doesn\u2019t show up for school.\u201d\nSo Ohio school districts tend to be cautious to protect students\u2019 identities, whether they\u2019re reporting numbers of children infected with meningitis or the flu.\nOften, they stick to numbers and make them as generic as possible, Tudor said. They typically report district-wide cases without ever identifying which schools were involved, let alone which classrooms, clubs or teams.\nCOVID-19 could be different\nEarlier this year, as the pandemic spread, the U.S. Department of Education released additional guidance to schools about releasing information about COVID-19 infections.\nRecognizing its risk and scale of spread, the agency noted that extraordinary circumstances might mean schools would need to share details that could identify a person with the coronavirus so others can \u201ctake appropriate precautions.\u201d\nDoes that open the door for schools to provide more detailed reporting if an outbreak happens among a particular school marching band, kindergarten class or school bus route?\nMaybe.\nDuring a press briefing last Thursday, DeWine sketched out the general terms of an order all Ohio schools will follow during the pandemic. Among other things:\nEvery district must have a mechanism, possibly existing attendance reporting systems, for parents and guardians of students and school staff to report positive COVID-19 tests of students. DeWine said other COVID-19 information could be shared on the school hotline, too. He didn\u2019t elaborate, but that could involve a student or staff member with symptoms, or someone who learned she was exposed to COVID-19.\nWithin 48 hours of receiving information on a positive test, the school district must report it to the local health department and make that information publicly available, possibly through a press release or a post to the school website or Facebook page. Districts must also provide parents and guardians with a copy of \u201cas much information as possible without disclosing protected health information,\u201d possibly through text or email.\nLocal health departments will collect the school data and share it with the state health department weekly. The state will compile the information and release it once a week.\nDeWine left lots of wiggle room about what parents, school staff and the public will learn about COVID-19 outbreaks \u2013 and what they won\u2019t.\n\u201cIf the community has widespread (COVID-19), it will be reflected in the school,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does not mean at all that the school has done anything wrong.\u201d\nAt the same time, schools will be working closely with local health departments. In Hamilton County, for example, the health department has assigned a team member to each school so that the department will have a quick response when questions arise. Spokesman Mike Samet said the health department will follow the direction of the state on reporting COVID-19 cases in schools.\nThe local health departments are also set to be involved in contact tracing.\n\"If we have a positive case at a school, we would contact that individual and work with the school to get a list of contacts, and the case will be reported as positive case in our county\u2019s totals,\" said Keith Robinson, Clermont County Health Department spokesman. But, he added, the county department does not plan to \"identify a school in which the student or staff member attends.\u201d\nContact tracers across the state will notify those who they believe may have been put at risk by being exposed to someone infected with COVID-19.\nBut that\u2019s likely far fewer people than might want to know if they\u2019ve had a brush with someone who tested positive, said Scott DiMauro, president of Ohio Education Association, which represents more than 100,000 teachers and staff working in Ohio\u2019s schools.\nContact tracing, he said, only works in schools if you can guarantee that everyone in a school maintained 6 feet of physical distancing, wore a mask and washed their hands as thoroughly and as often as they\u2019re supposed to 100% of the time.\n\u201cOur position is there needs to be transparency,\u201d DiMauro said. \u201cDon't disclose a name, but if there is a case in a particular building in a particular classroom on a particular day, tell us.\u201d\nDiMauro said the majority of OEA\u2019s members feel pretty good about the plans schools have laid to reopen.\nBut no one will know for another month to six weeks how successful schools are at preventing spread, so sharing information about COVID-19 outbreaks is important, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s common sense to assume every child and every adult in that confined space with limited air flow were all exposed,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I\u2019m a parent of one of those children, I absolutely want to know. If I\u2019m a teacher in that room, then I absolutely have a right to know.\u201d\nJust a snapshot in time\nDr. Joseph Zarconi, a professor and chair of internal medicine at the Northeast Ohio Medical University in Rootstown, said it\u2019s unlikely parents or teachers will get all of the information they may crave because of legally mandated privacy restrictions.\nBut that may not matter, he said.\n\u201cI think parents need to behave as though there is a kid infected in (their child\u2019s) class all of the time,\u201d Zarconi said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how reporting changes that.\u201d\nData, he cautioned, is always incomplete and only provides a snapshot in time.\n\u201cIn every type of pandemic...we always say you should be more concerned with what you don\u2019t know than what you do know,\u201d Zarconi said.\nIf a third-grader tests positive, for instance, he\u2019s no longer in school by the time the case is reported to the school and parents, teachers and the public are notified.\nBut what won\u2019t be clear for days or weeks is how many other people may have been infected before that child was kept home from school and tested, Zarconi said.\nHe also worries that COVID-19 infection information released by schools could inadvertently drive infection rates higher if the numbers are initially low and people have a false sense of safety.\n\u201cAs data start to come out, and numbers don\u2019t look bad, does that cause some of the families who said I\u2019m not going to send my kids back to change their minds and say, \u2018Maybe it\u2019s OK\u2019?\u201d Zarconi asked.\nMore children in schools mean a greater risk for infection, he said.\nInitially, low infection rates in schools also could cause people to drop their guard and become lax about enforcing social distancing and other measures to prevent the spread, he said.\nRegardless of information schools release about infections, Zarconi said he wouldn\u2019t risk children playing any fall sports.\n\u201cThe evidence is clear across the nation: Whenever we\u2019ve gone to more strict physical distancing, masks, hand hygiene, the number of infections drop,\u201d Zarconi said. \u201cNone of those things can be assured in athletics ... fall athletics should be shut down completely.\u201d\nExtra-curricular activities from chess club to marching band should be reassessed, too, he said.\nIf an activity, like the yearbook staff, can carry on remotely, he said, all activity should move online.\nFor others, like a chess club, safety might be more challenging, he said. While students could still mask and physically distance for chess matches, there is still built-in risk because players touch the same game pieces and then often touch their mask or faces.\nMarching band, Zarconi said, is a good example of being cautious about what we don\u2019t know during a pandemic.\nCOVID-19 often spreads through the air on invisible plumes of saliva when people exhale, cough or even sing. It\u2019s not clear if someone infected with COVID-19 might potentially spread the disease by blowing into a flute, trombone or clarinet.\n\u201cBut if you don\u2019t know whether 30 kids with wind instruments are blowing viruses all over the field,\u201d Zarconi said, \u201cact as if they are.\u201d\nEnquirer reporter Terry DeMio and USA TODAY contributed to this report. _ https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2020/08/31/covid-19-what-we-know-students-staff-infected-ohio-schools/3445865001/ _ Cincinnati Enquirer _ 2020-09-01 | "}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-117.07253, 32.77215]}, "properties": {"weight": 7.295836866004329, "name": "San Diego State University", "descriptions": "COVID infections spike at SDSU, leading county to check if an <b>outbreak</b> is under way _ The number of San Diego State University students who have tested positive for COVID-19 nearly doubled Monday, rising by 13.

She has declined several previous requests from the Union-Tribune to discuss the situation, including SDSU\u2019s decision to let 2,600 students live in dorms.\nThe university said that three of the 13 newly-confirmed infections involve students who live in Zapotec, Villa Alvarado Apartments and South Campus Plaza North, which are part of SDSU\u2019s dorm system. South Campus is near the university\u2019s transit station. There also has been at least one infection at M@College Apartments, an off-campus dorm. SDSU didn\u2019t specify a number.\nA total of 41 SDSU students, faculty, staff and independent contractors have tested positive for COVID-19 since testing began in the spring. About half of those infections have been reported over the past two weeks.\nThe infection rate could be higher. People are also being tested at a county facility on-campus. The county has not reported specific findings for that site.\n\u201cWe quickly identified and have spoken with the individuals known to have been in direct contact with the students,\u201d SDSU said in a statement. \u201cAgain, all are following established public health protocols for isolation and quarantine, and exposure risk to others on campus is deemed low.\u201d\nBrenden Tuccinardi, editor-in-chief of SDSU\u2019s Daily Aztec, says students have to shelter some of the blame for what\u2019s been happening.\n\"(Last) weekend and the weekend before made it very clear university administrators placed too much faith in students\u2019 ability to follow the rules,\u201d Tuccinardi said late Monday.\n\u201cThe recent measures taken to slow the spread at SDSU are a good first step, but at the end of the day, the burden does not fall solely on administration. Students need to call their friends out and police themselves or administration will be forced to step in.\u201d _ https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/education/story/2020-08-31/coronavirus-infections-sdsu _ San Diego Union-Tribune _ 2020-08-31 | San Diego State <b>University</b> reports 120 more <b>COVID-19</b> cases since fall start _ SAN DIEGO (KGTV) \u2014 San Diego State says 120 more confirmed and probably coronavirus cases have been reported in the school's off- and on-campus student population.\nThe new cases bring SDSU's total student COVID-19 count to 184 cases since the fall semester began last week.\nThe school says county health officials it investigating \"multiple clusters\" of coronavirus cases among students in the university community, including a previously announced outbreak on Wednesday.\nOfficials say among the cases, 14 groups have been identified within different locations. Some of these groups may eventually be linked to outbreaks.\nSDSU says none of the cases under investigation are related to on-campus educational activities, including classes or labs. No known cases have been reported in school faculty, staff, visitors, or vendors.\nThe school advised that all undergraduates students who have attended gatherings or think they may have been exposed should get tested and isolate themselves. The county estimated that each SDSU student case averages 4.5 contacts each.\n\u201cSDSU undergrads need to stay home within their living units this weekend and help us stop the spread within your campus community,\u201d said Wilma Wooten, County public health officer. \u201cIf you have been to parties and social events, you need to get tested, now. And isolate until you get results.\u201d\nStudents can call 2-1-1 or their medical providers and stay home if they become ill. They may also contact Student Health Services at 619-594-4325 (Monday through Friday) or the Nurse Call Line at 858-225-3105 (after hours and during weekends and holidays). Testing is available by appointment only and can be scheduled online here.\nThis week, SDSU moved all courses online for at least 4 weeks in response to the growing number of students testing positive. The campus had been hosting about 200 classes in-person, many of which were lab classes that were determined to only be possible in person.\nThursday, SDSU also paused all athletic events for two weeks.\nWhen the school becomes aware that a student resident has tested positive or is exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms, an Assessment and Response Team is used to isolate the sick student and, if needed, close contacts are notified, according to Luke Wood, Vice President for Student Affairs and Campus Diversity.\nSeveral campus apartments have been designated for isolating students when needed. For those isolated, a hygiene kit and food and meal delivery are provided by SDSU to those isolated students, Wood added.\nTo address the spread of the virus among students, the school banned fraternity events and instituted several policies, which include hiring security to patrol the campus after hours, document violations, and report to staff who handle disciplinary action. Greeters, or wellness ambassadors, are also on campus to remind students of COVID-19 policies.\nViolation of the policies can result in suspension or in extreme cases, expulsion.\nAs of Friday, SDSU has issued 457 COVID-19 policy violations. Of those, 285 have already been settled and eight organizations have been issued notices of investigation. Two notices to organizations are also in progress, Wood said.\nThe university is encouraging students to avoid gatherings over the Labor Day weekend and says more patrols have been established in the campus area ahead of the weekend. _ https://www.10news.com/news/coronavirus/san-diego-state-university-reports-120-more-covid-19-cases-since-fall-start _ ABC 10 News _ 2020-09-04 | "}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-86.80272, 33.50372]}, "properties": {"weight": 6.079441541679836, "name": "University of Alabama Birmingham", "descriptions": "UA official says &#39;nothing wrong&#39; with <b>school</b>&#39;s <b>COVID-19</b> measures _ The Tuscaloosa News\nAfter a rise in COVID-19 cases when students returned to classes, officials with the University of Alabama and the University of Alabama System are detailing their preparations and said it's likely safer for students to remain on campus.\nDr. Richard Friend, dean of UA\u2019s College of Community Health Sciences, spoke with members of the media via Zoom on Wednesday, saying \"Nothing has gone wrong\" with the UA approach as far as testing, sanitation and distancing measures in campus buildings, and preparations for quarantine and isolation space.\nLater that afternoon, a news release came from the UA System office quoting Dr. Mike Saag, professor of medicine in the University of Alabama at Birmingham Division of Infectious Diseases, and UAB Senior Vice President for Medicine and School of Medicine Dean Selwyn Vickers, both members of the UA System Health and Safety Task Force.\nThe release suggested it's safer to keep students on campus, where they have greater access to resources than the general public, than send students to various homes, where they could potentially spread the virus.\n\u201cThere is a strong feeling among public health and infectious disease experts that it is safer to keep students on a college campus where there is COVID-19 spread rather than closing campus and sending students home en masse,\u201d Saag was quoted as saying in the release.\nIn UA quarantine housing, Friend said, students have around-the-clock security, a medical liaison on call, and access to mental health resources. Campus-wide, UA can provide testing, PPE and other healthcare assistance.\n\u201cThe risk in closing a college campus and forcing thousands of students home at once is that the virus then has the opportunity to spread more widely to other geographic locations and possibly more vulnerable populations,\" Saag said in the release.\nAlthough positive COVID-19 tests have risen in Tuscaloosa since classes resumed in mid-August, Friend said there's no evidence any viral transmission has occurred in a UA classroom, and that there are no reports of students being hospitalized.\nThe online dashboard counter for the UA system tracks 158 COVID-19 positive cases on the UA campus from Jan. 1 to Aug. 18, with 562 from Aug. 19 to 24, and 481 from Aug. 25-27, for a total of 1,201.\nUAB's numbers were similar from January to Aug. 18, with 147 positives, but the Birmingham campus saw just one positive from Aug. 19-24, and nine from Aug. 25-27, for a total of 157.\nAt the University of Alabama in Huntsville, those numbers are zero, eight and two, for a total of 10. Dashboard figures are viewable at www.uasystem.edu/covid-19-dashboard/\n\"We (UA) have the largest campus in the state,\" Friend said, \"we have approximately 40,000 students, 6,000 faculty and staff, and we anticipated the quarantine and isolation space we needed, I think with great foresight, early in June.\"\nUA's isolation and quarantine space is at 36.09 percent occupancy, according to the dashboard, while UAB has zero percent occupancy, and UAB 11.5 percent occupancy of its isolation space.\nSentinel testing, sampling 2.5 to 4 percent of all students, faculty and staff, will begin at UA next week. Where it's already begun, with UAB academic faculty and staff, there have been zero out of 351 Sentinel positives, and for UAB clinical enterprise employees, two positives out of 1,275 Sentinel tests, for .16 percent positives.\n\"We know of no other university or university system with a more comprehensive testing plan, or one that has devoted more resources to testing, since our students arrived on campus,\" Friend said.\nIt's incumbent on everyone in all the campus communities to take personal responsibility, he said.\n\"I believe we have a real opportunity to reverse these trends, but it will take the full commitment of our students as I know they want to remain on campus, and that is a goal I believe we all share,\" he said.\nVickers echoed that in the release, saying \"Student behavior and compliance are some of the fundamental components of managing the outbreak.\"\nRisk-mitigation strategies can help flatten the curve, Friend said.\n\"We are able to operate safely with those tools, we're constantly refining our plans,\" he said. \"...The virus is really dictating where we are and how we move next.\"\nThe UA System updates dashboard numbers each Friday. At Tuesday's Tuscaloosa City Council meeting, Mayor Walt Maddox spoke of waiting for this week's numbers before deciding if his 14-day bar-closing order, set to expire at 5 p.m. Monday, will end then, or need to be extended. UA confers with Maddox daily, as well as with DCH Regional Medical Center, Friend said.\nOn Aug. 21, UA President Stuart R. Bell announced temporary directives restricting social gatherings in Greek houses, and in housing and residential communities, and a 14-day moratorium on all in-person student events outside of classroom instruction, social or otherwise.\n\"The additional measures enacted by the campus and the city,\" Friend said, \"to limit student activities and close the bars, are critical.\"\nBut measurement of their effectiveness remains to be seen, he added.\n\"I remain cautiously optimistic we\u2019re heading in the right direction, but truly we\u2019re not going to see the results of all our efforts until after Labor Day and possibly the week after that,\" he said.\n\"We have great concern about social gatherings off-campus, and I know the university has ramped up compliance efforts to help keep the campus community safe.\"\nFriend also addressed oncoming flu season, and suggested people get vaccinated beginning in mid-September.\n\"That is the next worst concern on my mind. and we\u2019re already planning for it,\" he said, \"UA has purchased over 10,000 doses of flu vaccine\" to be administered by the College of Community Health Sciences. He noted that in Australia they're showing the lowest flu counts on record, and that social distancing and masking are \"no doubt playing a part in that.\"\n\"As a clinician, as a hospital staff member, I certainly worry about the impact of flu and COVID together,\" he said.\nThe UA System health and safety plan, updated Aug. 28, is posted at www.uasystem.edu/comprehensivehealth-and-safety-plan-summary-of-plan-revisions. _ https://www.tuscaloosanews.com/story/news/2020/09/04/university-alabama-officials-defend-schools-covid-19-measures/5699500002/ _ Tuscaloosa News _ 2020-09-04 | "}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-122.88231999999999, 47.01828]}, "properties": {"weight": 6.079441541679836, "name": "Olympia High School", "descriptions": "Michigan football&#39;s Joe Milton era ready for takeoff: &#39;He&#39;s the alpha male&#39; _ Kyle Hayes still remembers where he was the first time he met Joe Milton.

(WMTV) - For many UW Madison students and parents, the COVID-19 dashboard is their main source for information.\n\u201cIt is far from a Freshman year to go there and be hunkered down in your dorms,\u201d said UW Madison parent, Laurie Frumiento.\nFrumiento, whose daughter is a freshman, lives in Maine. She said she is doing the best she can to keep up with what is going on at the campus from across the country. One of the ways she does that is through the dashboard.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those things where you don\u2019t really know the right answer. Is the right answer to stay home, is the right answer to go?\u201d she said.\nAjay Sethi, a UW Madison associate professor in population sciences who works on the dashboard, said while universities do not have to report the information, they know it is important to do so.\n\u201cDashboards are common, and I think transparency is paramount right now during our pandemic,\" he said.\nNBC15\u2032s national investigative team, InvestigateTV, poured over more than 100 COVID-19 dashboard websites from large universities across the country to see what information is shared and how.\nFrom displaying total positive and negative cases, to reporting isolated and quarantined students, the UW checked almost every box InvestigateTV looked into for transparency.\n\u201cI think it is important that the campus and broader communities have a centralized place to go and find out more about COVID-19, the cases on campus and also the universities response,\" Sethi said.\nHowever, UW\u2019s dashboard does not include active and recovered cases. Sethi explained they can only track data to a certain point.\n\u201cOnce a person tests positive for COVID, if their symptoms are going to require a hospitalization for example, we are not privy to that information and it is not sort of under our purview,\" he said. \u201cHospitalizations are reported to Public Health Madison Dane Co. and the state. If we learn of a hospitalization and subsequent recovery, it is because the person who tested positive and was hospitalized disclosed that information to us.\"\nOf the 107 schools InvestigateTV looked at, only 25 percent reported active cases. Less than half of the schools report the number of isolated students. UW Madison is one of them.\n\u201cFor those who are in isolation, by tracking that, that essentially is our active cases,\" Sethi said.\nDr. Howard Forman from Yale School of Public Health, has tracked national trends and created a website grading universities on their COVID-19 dashboards.\n\u201cMany of these universities are like small cities. So you\u2019re dealing in some cases, like Wisconsin, like Ohio State, some Florida schools, some Texas schools, with 30 or 40 thousand people who are living on one campus. And sometimes when you hear about a massive outbreak you may think that it\u2019s widespread across the campus, but it could be that two dormitories are badly infected, and everyone else is actually doing pretty well,\u201d Dr. Forman said.\nThe UW earned a B+, for things like being east to read and updated daily. UW Madison experts explain they are meeting on a daily basis to find ways to best provide the information.\n\u201cOur rating was done on September 1, and actually on September 3 we integrated information from Public Health Madison Dane Co. into our figures,\u201d Sethi said.\nFrumiento said she and her daughter rely on the transparency to get through.\n\u201cThe information that we have been getting, and I think her comfort there she has nothing but faith in the information she is receiving,\" Frumiento said.\nTwo schools scored higher than UW.

And, 120 people are currently hospitalized with the disease across the state.\nThe rolling seven-day average number of daily cases is 394, which is higher than numbers reported in the last couple weeks. The average percent of positive tests is 9.4%, which is three-tenths of a percentage point higher than Wednesday\u2019s average and seven-tenths of a percentage point higher than last Thursday.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing anything specific that is causing this increase,\u201d Dr. Angela Dunn, state epidemiologist said. She called Thursday\u2019s increase \u201cmodest\u201d and encouraged the public \u201cto remain vigilant with prevention measures that we know do work.\u201d\nDunn also warned Utahns to be prepared for the impending influenza season by getting the flu vaccine.\n\u201cNow is not too early to get that,\u201d she said. COVID-19, Dunn added, has been more deadly than the flu and has more long-term effects, some of which are still unknown.\n\u201cLet\u2019s take every possible measure to protect ourselves and our community this fall so our schools and businesses can stay open,\u201d she said.\nContrary to news released earlier this week from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Utah\u2019s testing capacity has remained robust enough to continue testing asymptomatic people in the state. In fact, Herbert said anyone can and should be tested for COVID-19 if they have even one symptom or otherwise feel the need to be tested.\nHe said the federal government will soon be sending rapid antigen testing materials to the state, which offers not only a more convenient way to test for COVID-19, but will help provide results much more quickly, even within 15 minutes.\nRapid tests will first go to prioritized groups, including first responders, schools, day care and long-term care facilities, as well as other groups dealing with critical infrastructure.\nCOVID-19 kills four more in Utah\nIn addition to the new cases, four more COVID-19 related deaths were reported by the health department, including three Salt Lake County men, two of whom were between ages 45 and 64, and one who was older than 85 years of age. All three were hospitalized at the time of their deaths. Also included in Thursday\u2019s death count was a Utah County man between the ages of 65 and 84, who was also hospitalized at the time of his death.\nThe state\u2019s death toll from the disease stands at 414.\nThe state has tested 668,425 people so far, with results from 5,234 people added since Wednesday.\nHerbert said Utah is faring well, given the circumstances.

She informed them that students will continue with online learning until they return to class \u2014 not on Oct. 1, after what would have been the end of a 14-day quarantine, but on Oct. 5 because of the Jewish holiday of Sukkot.\nInitially, public health investigators blamed the source of transmission on a Sept. 6 bar mitzvah attended by many students of Herzliah. However, the school also decided to probe the possibility of a COVID-19 outbreak within the walls of the institution itself.\nThe Mountain Sights Ave. school discovered Sept. 8 that a student tested positive for the coronavirus. Three days later, public health officials held a screening clinic at the school and determined that a total of eight students were infected in class 1C, along with one case each in classes 2C, 2E and 4C. One employee also tested positive.\nOn Wednesday, the school learned that another student tested positive in a fifth class, homeroom 2D.\n\u201cFollowing the announcement of a new case, we informed public health immediately and, late that evening, we received confirmation of their instructions,\u201d Toledano wrote to parents. \u201cWe apologize for this late notification.\n\u201cIn response to the situation at school and in order to limit the spread of the virus within our school community, public health has just authorized us to continue online learning \u2014 and to temporarily suspend in-person classes \u2014 for all our high-school classes for a period of two weeks.\u201d\nDr. Myl\u00e8ne Drouin, director of the Montreal public health department, confirmed the outbreak at Herzliah on Thursday morning as she gave an update on the latest epidemiological situation in the city. In addition to authorities posting 73 new COVID-19 cases in Montreal, they added a backlog of 222 from previous days.\n\u201cYou have to understand that the outbreaks we have now in the school milieu are small ones, with the exception of this school, which had a bigger outbreak,\u201d Drouin said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s often outbreaks of a few cases that are limited to a group or to a class of children. Clearly, the school milieu is safe for your children.\u201d\nIn contrast, Drouin added, the situation at Herzliah is \u201cmore complex.\u201d\n\u201cThe principal source of these cases was in the community, the acquisition of the virus was in the community. We had a first outbreak of eight students in a class of 15, and then after that we had sporadic cases at different levels. Therefore, we had several classes that had to be isolated.\n\u201cIn the context of the Jewish (high) holidays that are starting, and obviously the increase in the rate of incidence in this neighbourhood \u2026 we looked at different elements\u201d that resulted in the decision to move to online learning for the whole school, Drouin explained.\nIn her remarks, Drouin mentioned there were more than 15 COVID-19 cases at Herzliah.

These outbreaks are taking place in the Upper Cumberland and parts of West and East Tennessee and the number of hospitalized cases in those regions has started to climb over the last week.\n\u201cTennessee reached a high-water mark around 1,100 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in late July, and by late August those numbers had declined to under 900,\u201d said John Graves, associate professor of health policy and director of the Center for Health Economic Modeling at Vanderbilt. \u201cThe overall situation is stable at around 900 patients. But this overall stability masks progress in some areas, and a recent reversal of trends in others. Our aim with this analysis was to both highlight the positive news and to underscore the importance of continued diligence.\u201d\nGraves says there aren't obvious factors that would let his team attribute the rising number of hospitalizations to schools reopening or county-specific policies such as mask mandates. In the areas with recent upticks, data shows elderly people are becoming infected more frequently than in earlier stages of the pandemic, according to Graves.\nAlthough it is too soon to tell what impact reopening schools will have on the outbreak, Meharry Medical College President and infectious disease expert James Hildreth told the Post in August the increase in transmission will be seen on a regional basis. Counties without mitigation efforts \u2014 i.e. the use of facial coverings, alternative learning strategies in schools \u2014 face the risk of clustering that can turn into widespread outbreaks in a relatively short amount of time.\nHospital bed and medical device availability continue to fluctuate across the state. Nearly 17 percent (1,985) of all floor beds and 15 percent (307) of ICU beds in Tennessee are available. Statewide numbers do not tell the whole story, though. Most infectious disease experts \u2014 and the data \u2014 look at outbreaks of COVID-19 by region due to the state\u2019s county-level approach to mitigating the epidemic.\nWhile the number of active cases in Nashville has fallen by nearly 1,400 in the past two weeks, counties in the regions described above \u2014 namely Carroll, Carter, Cumberland, Fentress, Gibson, Greene, Hardin, McMinn, Monroe, Sullivan and Wayne \u2014 have all seen increases of more than 50 active cases over the past two weeks. That shows the virus is continuing to spread in the state\u2019s more rural, less populated counties.\nAccording to the Sycamore Institute\u2019s Health Care Capacity Dashboard, the average number of residents per staffed inpatient bed across the state is 421 per bed. Most of the counties now seeing more cases and hospitalizations have fewer beds than the average. While the state does not provide capacity reports for individual hospitals, the Department of Health has confirmed no regional systems have yet been overwhelmed due to COVID hospitalizations. The majority, if not all, of the state's hospitals have reopened elective surgeries.\nThe rising spread among older residents in some rural areas likely is spurring the increase in hospitalizations since people with pre-existing medical conditions and an overall weaker immune system are more susceptible to developing severe symptoms. The typical length of hospitalization among survivors of COVID is 10 to 13 days. Medicaid data shows nearly 35 percent of its enrollees are staying longer than that.\nOverall, the outbreak appears to be stabilizing in most of the state. But upticks in transmission within one county can quickly spread to another and set off a chain reaction that fills hospital beds in areas that aren\u2019t as developed to withstand high volumes of patients.\n\u201cWhat our analysis does makes clear is that as we approach the fall, we\u2019re not close to being out of the woods,\u201d Graves wrote in the report. \"We have to keep our focus on taking care of ourselves and our neighbors.

The work is expected to be completed in the next six to nine days and be opening for testing by Oct. 1, according to the email.\nThe structure comes in response to the state\u2019s mandate that vehicle emissions testing sites \u2014 which were being used as temporary coronavirus test sites \u2014 revert to testing cars by October, the email states.\nVickie Bands, director of community outreach and health improvement for UCH, said the state is also interested in in site as a template to possibly roll out indoor testing across the state. The temporary indoor testing site will use negative air pressure to minimize risks for coronavirus exposure, according to the email.\nAt Upper Chesapeake Medical Center in Bel Air, COVID-19 patients have been treated in negative pressure rooms, which allow hospitals to regulate the flow of air into and out of a COVID patient\u2019s room and avoid contamination throughout the rest of the hospital.\nBands said the temporary structure will require a new process. UCH has drive-through testing \u201cdown to a science,\" she said, but inviting people into an enclosed room comes with precautions.\nOnly six people will be tested in the building at any one time, Bands said. Masks will be required and social distancing will be observed. Those seeking tests will have to wait outside the building \u2014 which Bands likened to a temporary office on a construction site \u2014 until they receive a text message telling them to come inside.\nThe impetus for moving testing indoors, Bands said, is the draining nature of testing outdoors. While the heat was rough on staff this summer, the winter cold is another challenge.\nAnyone can make an appointment to be tested at the new site, even without a doctor\u2019s note or insurance. The Aberdeen site will be open from 10 a.m. to noon on Mondays, 8 a.m to noon on Wednesday, 3 to 7 p.m. on Thursdays and 10 a.m. to noon on Fridays.\nTesting is free for people without insurance, and there is no fee for people with insurance, although insurance will be charged.\nGenerally, COVID-tests have been outdoors, often without making those seeking tests leave their cars, because of the virus' easier transmission in indoor spaces. According to the email, a temporary structure could also smoothly pivot to become a vaccination site when a vaccine becomes available.\nThe tests done at the site will be sent to either LabCorp or the University of Maryland Medical System Lab, if someone is getting a pre-surgical test. Turnaround times for test results are expected to be between 24 and 48 hours. Bands said LabCorp generally gets test results back after roughly two days.\nThe types of tests will vary based on the availability of swabs; they can either be nose or cheek tests, the email states.\nAccording to the email, UCH has also prioritized testing of emergency workers, giving the example of sheriff\u2019s deputy who needs to be cleared before returning to work.\nUCH has conducted a number of testing initiatives \u2014 including a one-day drive-through test collection at Ripken Stadium in August. More than 700 people were tested at the site, according to Molly Mraz, a spokesperson for the Harford County Health Department.\nMany COVID and flu symptoms are similar to each other, and Harford County\u2019s former health officer, Russell Moy, and infectious disease expert at UCH Faheem Younus have urged county residents to get vaccinated for the flu to ward off a potential conjunction of the sickness and coronavirus.\nUCH will have a free, drive-through flu vaccination clinic on Tuesday, Sept. 29, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the Forest Hill VEIP station for people ages 12 and older.

Up to now, I have body aches, it hurt more yesterday than today, like a bad cold,\u201d the president said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a fever, I have a bit of a cough.\u201d\n\u201cI am busy working from home,\u201d he said.\nGiammattei, 64, has multiple sclerosis and uses canes to walk.\nThe government press office said in a statement that Giammattei \u201cwill be isolating himself from all public activity, and so all communication will be conducted remotely.\u201d\nThe announcement came on the same day that the country reopened its borders and international flights after a six-month closure due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nHawaii will repoen to tourists Oct. 15 \u2013 with some conditions\nTravelers can finally return to Hawaii starting next month.\nBeginning Oct. 15, visitors can travel to the islands if they take a coronavirus test and test negative within 72 hours of their arrival in the state, or go into a 14-day quarantine once they arrive.\nGov. David Ige, a Democrat, announced plans for the pre-travel testing program at a news conference this week.\nIge said pharmacy chain CVS and health-care provider Kaiser Permanente will offer tests as part of an agreement with the state.

The state hasn\u2019t said where the studies are being conducted.\nMinnesota Department of Health spokeswoman Julie Bartkey told the St. Paul Pioneer Press that the team did the right thing by leaving the situation and notifying a site coordinator.\n\u201cThe vast majority of neighborhoods have been friendly, but we will continue to monitor for concerns as we move through different areas of the state,\u201d Bartkey said. \u201cIt could have been a simple misunderstanding, we simply don\u2019t know.\u201d\nThe workers from the state Department of Health and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are wearing credentials as they knock on doors. Households are chosen at random, and state officials have encouraged participation if asked. The study includes an interview and testing for active COVID-19 infections as well as antibody testing that would indicate a previous exposure.\nThe incident came to light after at least two Twin Cities-area police departments posted an email from the Minnesota Department of Public Safety on their social media accounts. The message said: \u201ca team of MDH and CDC examiners was recently confronted by a group of armed citizens while out in a neighborhood.\u201d\nMinnesota reported an additional 1,099 cases of the coronavirus on Friday, and eight new deaths, bringing the state\u2019s totals to 87,807 confirmed cases and 1,950 deaths since the pandemic began.\nPush is underway to test COVID-19 vaccines in diverse groups\nTAKOMA PARK, Md. \u2014 In front of baskets of tomatoes and peppers, near a sizzling burrito grill, the \u201cpromotoras\u201d stop masked shoppers at a busy Latino farmers market: Want to test a COVID-19 vaccine?\nAided by Spanish-speaking \u201chealth promoters\u201d and Black pastors, a stepped-up effort is underway around the U.S. to recruit minorities to ensure potential vaccines against the scourge are tested in the populations most ravaged by the virus.\nMany thousands of volunteers from minority groups are needed for huge clinical trials underway or about to begin. Scientists say a diverse group of test subjects is vital to determining whether a vaccine is safe and effective for everyone and instilling broad public confidence in the shots once they become available.\nThe expanded outreach by vaccine researchers and health officials is getting a late start in communities that, because of a history of scientific exploitation and racism, may be the most reluctant to roll up their sleeves.\nFederica Narancio/Associated Press\nJust getting the word out takes time.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about the vaccine until now,\u201d said Ingrid Guerra, who signed up last week at the farmers market in Takoma Park, Maryland, outside the nation\u2019s capital.\nThe health promoters from CASA, a Hispanic advocacy group, explained how the research process works and how a vaccine could help end the coronavirus pandemic.\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid,\u201d Guerra decided. \u201cI want to participate for me, my family, my people.\u201d\nUniversity of Maryland researchers agreed to set up a temporary lab at CASA\u2019s local community center so that people struggling financially wouldn\u2019t have to travel to participate.\nThe hardest part, many experts say, is gaining trust.\n\u201cA white guy from NIH is probably not going to be as effective by far in convincing somebody from a minority community that this is the kind of science they might want to trust, as would a doctor from their own community,\u201d said Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health.\nRecruiting African Americans in particular will be \u201ca heavy, heavy lift,\u201d Collins said, because of the legacy of mistrust after the infamous Tuskegee experiment, when Black men in Alabama were left untreated for syphilis as part of a study that ran from the 1930s into the \u201870s.\nRead the full story here.\nA Mass. teenager tested positive for the coronavirus. His parents sent him to school anyway.\nSix students tested positive for the novel coronavirus days before Attleboro High School in Massachusetts reopened its doors for the first day of school this week. Only five of them stayed home, the city\u2019s mayor told WJAR.\nThe parents of the sixth student who tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 sent him to class anyway, the mayor said. Now, 28 students who were in close contact with the teenager have to quarantine for two weeks.\n\u201cIt was a reckless action to send a child \u2014 a teenager \u2014 to school who was COVID-positive,\u201d Attleboro Mayor Paul Heroux (D) told WHDH. \u201cIt was really poor judgment. If you know that your child has coronavirus, is covid-positive, you should not send your child to school under any circumstances.\u201d\nAs the new academic year begins, schools nationwide have had to cope with students coming to school despite knowing that they have the highly infectious virus. In Oklahoma City, a student also attended the first day in class despite testing positive for the coronavirus. The parents of the student said they thought the quarantine was only for five days because the child was asymptomatic. As a result, 17 students had to quarantine. A student in Greenfield, Ind., meanwhile, tested positive on the first day of school after the parents sent the child while awaiting test results.\nThe student in Attleboro, located almost 40 miles southwest of Boston, tested positive for the coronavirus on Sept. 11, Heroux told CNN. But the school was unaware of his results when he arrived for the first day on Sept. 14.\nThe high school became aware of the student\u2019s positive test because of rumors \u201ccirculating around town,\u201d Runey told NBC. The suspicions were reported to the city\u2019s bureau of health, which \u201cdid some checking and found out that it was true, that he had tested positive,\u201d Runey said.\nIn a letter to families in the school district, which was reviewed by WHDH, Superintendent David Sawyer said that the school\u2019s nurses used contact tracing to identify and notify those who were in close contact with the student.\n\u201cThis is bad. Parents are really angry,\u201d Heroux told WJAR.\nFlorida, Texas and Nevada take steps toward 2nd reopening\nSeveral states that moved quickly to lift lockdown restrictions this summer \u2014 only to slam the brakes as coronavirus infections began surging \u2014 are once again moving ahead with reopening.\nIn Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott (R) announced Thursday that restaurants, retail stores and gyms in most parts of the state could resume operating at 75 percent occupancy, the limit that was in place in June before Abbott reversed course and imposed new restrictions. Bars, however, will remain closed. The state is also resuming elective surgeries in most hospital districts, with exceptions for parts of the Rio Grande Valley that are still seeing high numbers of hospitalizations.\nIn Nevada, a state coronavirus task force authorized reopening bars in Clark County, where Las Vegas is located, for the first time since July. Shutdowns were also lifted for Elko County, which had been the only other county where bars remained closed because of a failure to meet key testing metrics.\nRob O\u2019Neal/Associated Press\nFlorida also plowed ahead with reopening this week, allowing bars statewide to welcome back patrons at 50 percent capacity. Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) initially closed bars when outbreaks began appearing in March, but allowed them to reopen in early June, a move that was followed by a steep uptick in cases. Later that month, state liquor regulators intervened and shut down bars for a second time.\nAccording to Politico Florida, contact tracing teams determined that many of the summer outbreaks were spawned by a handful of bars that flouted social distancing and capacity regulations. Halsey Beshears, the secretary of the state\u2019s Department of Business and Professional Regulation, said in a statement last week that he believed bars and breweries would do better the second time around.\n\u201cIt\u2019s vital that we start moving forward with this sector of our hospitality industry who have endured one of the toughest paths for sustaining a business during this pandemic,\u201d he said.\nDeSantis also said last week that he expects to soon lift a restriction limiting indoor dining to 50 percent capacity, according to Politico.\nGlobal virus cases top 30 million, 6.7 million in U.S. alone\nLONDON \u2013 Confirmed cases of the coronavirus have topped 30 million worldwide, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally.\nThe worldwide count of known COVID-19 infections climbed past 30 million on Thursday, with more than half of them from just three countries: the U.S., India and Brazil, according to the tally kept by Johns Hopkins researchers.\nThe number increased by 10 million in just over a month; global cases passed 20 million on August 12.\nThe United States leads the by-country count with at least 6,675,560 reported cases, followed by India with at least 5,214,677 and Brazil at 4,455, 386, the numbers showed.\nIndividual numbers could vary as the university\u2019s tally sometimes lags behind country reports.\nThe U.S. also leads in the number of deaths at 197,643, followed by Brazil at 134,935 and India with a death toll of 84,372, the tally showed.\nBritain considers new curbs on pubs and restaurants\nLONDON \u2014 British Health Secretary Matt Hancock has hinted that fresh restrictions on social gatherings in England could be announced soon as part of efforts to suppress a sharp spike in confirmed coronavirus cases.\nFollowing reports that the government was considering fresh curbs on the hospitality sector, such as pubs and restaurants, Hancock said this is a \u201cbig moment for the country.\u201d\nHe said that another national lockdown is the \u201clast line of defense\u201d and that most transmissions of the virus are taking place in social settings.\nHancock says the government\u2019s strategy over the coming weeks is to contain the virus as much as possible \u201cwhilst protecting education and the economy.\u201d\nThe government has come under sustained criticism in the past week following serious issues with its virus testing program.\nThere\u2019s widespread speculation that parts of northwest England will see further restrictions announced Friday.\nIndia\u2019s infections not slowing\nNEW DELHI \u2014 India\u2019s coronavirus cases have jumped by another 96,424 infections in the past 24 hours, showing little signs of slowing down.\nThe Health Ministry on Friday raised the nation\u2019s confirmed total since the pandemic began to more than 5.21 million.

Security Council of his warning five months ago that \u201cthe world stood on the brink of a hunger pandemic,\u201d and welcomed the response, which averted famine and led countries to fight back against the coronavirus.\nBeasley said the U.N. food agency is keeping people alive \u201cand avoiding a humanitarian catastrophe\u201d but he said \u201cthe fight is far, far, far from over.\u201d\nNew Zealand reports no new cases for the first time in 5 weeks\nWELLINGTON, New Zealand \u2014 New Zealand has reported no new confirmed cases of the coronavirus for the first time in more than five weeks as hopes rise that an outbreak discovered in Auckland last month has been stamped out.\nFriday\u2019s report also marked the fourth consecutive day without any cases of community transmission.

It also illustrates the school\u2019s flexibility and readiness in adapting procedures \u2013 including the use of germ-killing ultraviolet wands and lamps \u2013 in response to public health recommendations. The RaMHS unit will provide a second location for students to receive daily temperature screenings, making campus arrival and check-in more efficient.\n\u201cThe Barstow School is pleased to partner with Black & Veatch to offer the innovative RaMHS unit to our school community,\u201d said Shane Foster, president of The Barstow School, which emphasizes science, technology, engineering, math (STEM) and the arts (STEAM). \u201cAs we are firmly committed to ensuring the health and safety of our students and to showing them how innovation results in real-world solutions, this partnership provides an effective way to achieve both goals.\u201d\nDeveloped by Black & Veatch \u2013 a 105-year-old global infrastructure leader with vast experience in pathogen-tracking methods and the construction of biological safety-related facilities \u2013 the RaMHS units are scalable, intermodal containers transformed into comfortable sites for COVID-19 screening and other diagnostic purposes, as well as vaccination distribution and personal protective equipment (PPE) disinfection and dispensing. These windowed modules come in various sizes and configurations, electrical hook-up ready, weather-resistant, climate controlled, and lockable, providing security for personnel and equipment in any environment. The units can be outfitted with the latest in COVID response technology from a variety of partners.\nThe uniquely adaptable RaMHS module, which provides an alternate testing and screening site outside of traditional emergency room or doctor office settings, gives schools, health-care sites, office parks, government locations, commercial and industrial businesses, and retail locations the peace of mind of having a reliable, affordable coronavirus testing place within days. RaMHS modules already have been put to use by a Kansas City-area health system and by the University of Kansas.\n\u201cWe applaud The Barstow School\u2019s proactiveness in safeguarding the health and safety for its students and employees,\u201d said Dave Johnson, the RaMHS solutions team leader at Black & Veatch, which also is exploring options to collaborate with Barstow in transforming a former supermarket into an off-campus site. \u201cThrough that conversion effort and RaMHS, we look forward to building a continuing partnership with Barstow that shares our passion for STEM and safety.\u201d\nThe climate-controlled RaMHS modules can be quickly daisy-chained to meet community and regional demands. In conjunction with other personal protective gear, this design can reduce exposure risks. RaMHS also is a hub where personal protection equipment can be disinfected and data can be harvested and analyzed to record and measure where patients have been.\nThe RaMHS program follows the recent announcement of Black & Veatch\u2019s Growth Accelerator incubator to find and collaborate with startups and other innovators to expedite solutions that soften COVID-19\u2019s impact. As a virtual, remote effort, the 2020 Black & Veatch IgniteX COVID-19 Response Accelerator has engaged companies and entrepreneurs who have real-time ideas about how to mitigate the coronavirus outbreak and need help commercializing, rapidly deploying and scaling those concepts.\nEditor\u2019s Note:\nFor more information about RaMHS and other Black & Veatch COVID response solutions, including COVOPERATE, powered by Field2Base, an enterprise access-management platform that tracks daily management of the health statuses of individuals while delivering targeted access controls for managers charged with the safe operation of any place of work or education.\nThe rollout of the RaMHS containers amplifies Black & Veatch\u2019s innovation in addressing biologically and medically dangerous threats.

Of those, he said seven were in the vanpool and eight \u201care the result of close contact with members of the vanpool or work in the same vicinity as the positive vanpool members.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t clear Thursday what caused the discrepancy in the case totals.\n\u201cSince March, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard has emphasized the importance of remaining vigilant at work, at home and in the community in order to minimize the risk of spread of coronavirus,\u201d Hildreth said in the statement.

The jail outbreak began with a jail employee who attended a wedding and reception in the Millinocket area on Aug. 7 that has been connected to 177 cases statewide and seven deaths.\nThe pastor at Calvary Baptist Church, Todd Bell, officiated at the wedding, although there is not yet a firm epidemiological link between the outbreak at Calvary Baptist and the wedding.\nAlso on Thursday, Gov.

Of those 84, 23 lived on campus and the rest rent apartments in neighborhoods near the school.\nCollege president the Rev. Kenneth R. Sicard also ordered all on-campus students to stay on campus and off-campus students to self-quarantine in their apartments, to not hold any gatherings indoors or outdoors, and to stay away from bars, restaurants, clubs, and neighborhood businesses \u2014 or they will be suspended.\nCollege staff, Providence police, and private security will monitor the off-campus apartments 24 hours a day, he said.\nSicard also raised the specter of classes not resuming at all, and the spring semester being canceled, if students do not follow the directives from the college and the state Department of Health.\n\u201cThis is the biggest cluster of cases we have had in colleges and universities in Rhode Island,\u201d Department of Health spokesman Joseph Wendelken said. \u201cWe spent a lot of time in the spring and summer focusing on nursing homes, and this highlights that there are challenges in all congregate living settings.\u201d\nAll Providence College students are being tested, and the Health Department \u201cstrongly encouraged\u201d all college students who live in the area and employees of businesses that interact with the students to be tested.\nThe Elmhurst area where many Providence College students live also houses students from nearby Johnson & Wales and Rhode Island College. A visit to the neighborhood Friday morning showed a plethora of delivery trucks, including from Stop & Shop, Amazon, and FedEx.\nTesting of people without symptoms is done at the Rhode Island Convention Center. Appointments are required. To schedule an appointment, go to portal.ri.gov. Anyone who has symptoms should contact their doctor or a local health facility.\n\u201cWe recognize how serious and difficult these directives are, but this is our last chance to remain together in person for the fall semester,\u201d Sicard wrote in a letter to the Providence College community. \u201cBetween these actions and the serious steps we already have taken \u2014 especially in the past few days \u2014 we have used virtually every tool at our disposal. We are out of options. If we are not successful, we will have no alternative other than to shut down our campus for the remainder of the fall semester. This also will likely affect our ability to reopen for the spring semester.\u201d\nSteven J. Maurano, a spokesman for the college, said officials are trying to figure out how the outbreak began. He said the college has not had large gatherings like those seen at other places, such as Syracuse University. But officials are hearing that there might have been a gathering at an off-campus house of 30 or 40 people over the weekend.\n\u201cWith this virus, that is all it takes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know for sure if that is ground zero.\"\nMaurano said it\u2019s too early to focus on disciplining students. At this point, the emphasis is getting students into quarantine and isolation, he said.\nWhile the majority of students who have tested positive live off campus, he said that 23 of the 84 students who tested positive live in Providence College residence halls. Other students included in the total of 124 tested positive at off-campus test sites, he said.\nMaurano said it\u2019s too soon to say if the college will stick with distance learning beyond Sept. 26. He said other colleges that had outbreaks went to remote instruction for two weeks before allowing students to return to classrooms. He said the college will have a better idea of how to proceed after testing of students is completed next week.\nMaurano said he does not think it was a mistake to bring students back to start the fall semester.\n\u201cThe numbers were pretty good until the middle of this week,\u201d he said. \u201cThe large majority of students were and are complying with all the mandates and guidelines. But this virus is pretty insidious. If you have one gathering where someone is positive \u2014 boom \u2014 all of a sudden you can have 30 or 40 positive cases, and they pass it to their contacts.\u201d\nProvidence City Councilman David A. Salvatore said that when he drove to work Friday morning he saw red and blue Solo cups scattered along Eaton Street \u2014 a telltale sign of off-campus student partying. Also, he said constituents have reported students moving around the area without face masks.\n\u201cThere seems to be a culture of defiance among some students in the Providence College community,\u201d Salvatore said.\nSalvatore, who represents the city\u2019s Elmhurst and Wanskuck neighborhoods, said the outbreak endangers residents who live near the campus.\n\u201cI commend Providence College for the increased level of communication,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they can\u2019t police every student 24/7. At some point, ownership falls on the students who are visiting Rhode Island for their college experience to adhere to the expectations. This has to be taken seriously.\u201d\nProvidence College students have faced previous criticism during the pandemic. In May, Providence City Councilwoman Kat Kerwin said she received multiple calls from people who said they \u201cwitnessed reckless partying on Eaton Street,\u201d near the college. At the time, the state had an order in place limiting social gatherings to no more than five people.\nIn August, college officials suspended 17 students for violating the school\u2019s coronavirus code of conduct.\nBrian Donohue-Lynch, who lives near the campus in the Elmhurst neighborhood, said the students and residents of the surrounding area go to the same places \u2014 such as the LaSalle Bakery, Shaw\u2019s supermarket, and Dunkin' Donuts \u2014 and they rely on the same pizza delivery and supermarket delivery services.\nSo it\u2019s not as if the students are living in some kind of bubble that would protect neighbors, he said.\n\u201cThese are students who are integrated in their neighborhoods,\u201d Donohue-Lynch said. \u201cSo to see that there is an outbreak among Providence College students means it\u2019s a hotspot in our neighborhood that affects all of us.\u201d\nHolly Taylor Coolman, a professor at the college who lives near campus, said it\u2019s important to take the virus seriously, but she acknowledged that she does want students to learn on campus.\n\u201cMost of us are still hopeful that there is a chance we can stay on campus and learn together as a community,\u201d Coolman said. \u201cThat said, it is not easy to adopt new protocols that feel awkward. And we have to take the virus seriously. We may have to accept that this just won\u2019t work.\u201d\nDan McGowan can be reached at dan.mcgowan@globe.com. Follow him on Twitter at @danmcgowan.

The University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign, which has performed almost 200,000 tests on students, faculty and staff in twice-weekly screenings, warned Wednesday of a worrisome increase in virus cases.\nRisky behavior by undergraduates was to blame, including partying and ignoring quarantine guidance, the university said. It is disciplining more than 100 students and several organizations.\n\u201cThe irresponsible and downright dangerous actions of a small number of our students have created the very real possibility of ending an in-person semester,\u201d Chancellor Robert Jones said Wednesday.\nAt Iowa State University in Ames, the positivity rate during the first week of classes, which started Aug. 17, was 13.6%. In the second week, it shot to 28.8% on the campus of more than 31,000 students.\nLarge parties and gatherings were the cause, President Wendy Wintersteen said in a statement. The university expanded testing and contact tracing, and enacted new requirements such as face coverings. Calls from the community also led Wintersteen to reverse course and not allow any fans to watch the home opener football game Sept. 12 in the stadium. The school had previously planned to allow 25,000 people, less than half the capacity.\nAt Ohio State University, President Kristina Johnson sent an email to the more than 60,000 students, faculty and staff Thursday urging them all to \u201cact as though you are positive\u201d going into Labor Day weekend.\nBetween Aug. 14 and Sept. 1, about 1.6% of the public flagship\u2019s student population \u2014 1,052 students \u2014 contracted the disease.

He and his two roommates tested negative upon arrival, but his dorm was quarantined Aug. 29. He was told this past week that students had to leave university housing by Sept. 20 and now, he\u2019s quarantining alone in a triple room.\nChristopher and his parents would like him to stay in Colorado and take advantage of the outdoor activities.\n\u201cHe and a number of other students are trying to find housing,\u201d said Laurie Meehan. \u201cSome are looking in mountain towns because there are so many rental properties available.\u201d\nThe reversals have been predictable, said Robert Kelchen, an associate professor of higher education at Seton Hall University in South Orange, N.J. \u201cColleges told their students most of the summer that things would be reasonably close to normal,\u201d Kelchen said. \u201cThey expected college students to stay to themselves or in very small groups of friends.

UW-O also cited claims from University of Arizona and University of Idaho, who say potential outbreaks were averted on their campuses due in part to wastewater testing. _ https://www.nbc26.com/news/local-news/uw-oshkosh-to-begin-testing-dorm-wastewater-for-covid-19 _ NBC26 _ 2020-09-18 | "}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-74.17631999999999, 40.74287]}, "properties": {"weight": 6.079441541679836, "name": "New Jersey Institute of Technology", "descriptions": "NJIT detects <b>COVID-19</b> in sewage, quarantines entire dormitory _ Project engineers ran a pump to suck up sewage samples through a tube snaking down into a manhole. It\u2019s tucked into the corner of a campus lawn at New Jersey Institute of Technology where they test sewage weekly for the coronavirus because people infected with COVID-19 excrete virus when they go to the bathroom. It\u2019s a big red flag.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an early warning system because you\u2019re shedding the virus before you would test positive for a sample of an individual,\u201d said NJIT Executive Director of Environmental Health and Safety Mitchell Gayer.\n\u201cPositive people discharge the RNA mostly before they even know they\u2019re positive. This is an early indicator, days ahead,\u201d said Veronica Kero, president of Omega Environmental Services.\n\u201cThe goal is to quickly identify when there is a positive case on campus, and isolate the individual or individuals who have that before there\u2019s an opportunity for spread to occur,\u201d said NJIT Chief Strategy Officer Matthew Golden.\nThe school monitored its sewage at seven sites on campus since classes started in September. On Sept. 16, NJIT got a red flag \u2014 a positive COVID-19 test in sewage from Cypress Hall, a dorm with 300 students. Cypress went into immediate lockdown.\n\u201cYeah, they\u2019re pretty upset about it because they don\u2019t want to be stuck in their rooms all day,\u201d said Matthew Dizon, a student who has friends in the dorm. \u201cBut it is what it is. You\u2019ve got to do your best to keep people safe. I\u2019m glad that NJIT\u2019s doing their best to test for things.\u201d\n\u201cThese are likely asymptomatic individuals, and if we had no wastewater testing in place, they could potentially be spreading the virus within the residence hall or within the campus community unchecked,\u201d said Golden.\nEvery Cypress Hall resident immediately got tested for COVID-19 to find who could be infected. No one\u2019s showing symptoms. Administrators alerted the entire campus.\n\u201cI\u2019m a little paranoid about the corona stuff, but it helps me feel safer to come in knowing that they\u2019re taking the testing seriously and they\u2019re taking the steps to test immediately the moment they find something out that\u2019s wrong,\u201d said student Santiago Ovalles.\n\u201cWe know that it\u2019s going to be safer. Instead of like some schools they really don\u2019t test that often and they don\u2019t take it seriously like here,\u201d said student Manuela Estella-Gomez.\nNJIT is in downtown Newark, so every week the school tests 400 students, faculty and staff at random for COVID-19. So far, they\u2019ve gotten three positives that way. But testing the sewage allows them to cast a wider net for the virus.\nNJIT\u2019s sewage collection sites focus on distinct residential groups.\n\u201cEach site represents a dormitory and these are the greek houses over here. So these smaller houses, we test them all at once,\u201d said Gayer.\nProfessor Lucia Rodriguez-Freire suggested NJIT test sewage for COVID-19 noting similar virus surveillance programs exist at several universities, more than 40 states, the Netherlands, Finland and Spain.\n\u201cThe good thing about it is, we don\u2019t have to test individuals. We can test the whole community, and see if something is going on,\u201d said Rodriguez-Freire.\nDr. Martin Blaser, director of theCenter for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine at Rutgers University, explains testing sewage lets public health officials scale up COVID-19 surveillance to entire city sewage systems where engineers can trace positives to identify hot spots.\n\u201cEverybody has to go to the bathroom, so you can test sewage so that you can test a whole dormitory, or you can test a whole campus, or you can test a whole factory,\u201d said Blaser. \u201cThey can get it down to the individual house. So it\u2019s a very powerful technique which is now being used all over the country in different studies using sewage to identify people who are shedding the COVID virus.\u201d\nTracking disease in sewage isn\u2019t a new idea. In 1850s London, Dr. John Snow stopped a deadly cholera outbreak by showing people got sick drinking water from a certain well that was contaminated by sewage from a single infected family\nModern disease detectives adapted techniques for COVID-19, but it\u2019s useless without quarantining.\n\u201cThis tells you who you need to quarantine and where to look for the people to quarantine. Otherwise it\u2019s like a needle in a haystack,\u201d said Blaser.\nCypress Hall students who test positive will be quarantined in separate spaces.

With saliva testing, all we have to do is spit into a small tube, fill the tube up just a little bit, and that gives us the sample that we need,\u201d said Dr. Richard Orlandi, U. Health chief medical officer of ambulatory health.\n\u201cWe can get a very accurate test, as accurate as the traditional back of the nose test ... and we can do it just as fast with the same turnaround time, usually about 24 to 48 hours,\u201d he said.\nU. researchers said in late August that saliva samples are easier to collect and appear to be safer for test administrators as those getting tested are less likely to produce the aerosols that transmit the coronavirus as compared to the nasal swab test. Saliva testing also enables the use of less personal protective equipment, researchers said.\nThe health care system will still offer nasal swabs in rare cases; for example, when a patient has dry mouth or another condition that makes nasal testing necessary, Orlandi said.\nThe change comes as Utah has continued to perform a lower number of tests each day than it did during the state\u2019s surge in June and July. While testing capacity remains at 7,000 a day, an average between 2,000 and 5,000 people each day have actually gotten tested for the past several weeks.\nState officials continue to urge anyone with one or more symptoms including fever, cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, sore throat, or a loss in sense of taste or smell to get tested. Those who are asymptomatic but had close contact with a confirmed case are also encouraged to get tested.\nNew cases rising above the 400 benchmark\nUtah continued to see an uptick in new COVID-19 cases on Friday as another 513 were confirmed, as well as five additional deaths.\nThe new cases were reported out of 6,057 tests, with an 8.5% positive rate, according to the Utah Department of Health.\nSince the pandemic began, Utah has confirmed 53,839 cases of 679,716 people tested.\nThe rolling seven-day average for new cases again surpassed 400 on Friday. The average is now 411 cases per day, and the average positive test rate is 9.4%.\nIn the last two weeks, much of the state has continued to see either a moderately high rate or high rate of new COVID-19 cases, according to state health department data. The only areas seeing a low rate include San Juan County \u2014 which once had among the highest rates of disease in the state \u2014 as well as Duchesne, Grand and Emery counties.\nMany rural towns in southern and central Utah, including Blanding, Monticello, Richfield, Monroe, Salina, Delta and Fillmore, are also seeing low rates of the disease, as well as much of southwest Utah excluding Washington and Iron counties.\nGov. Gary Herbert had challenged Utah to reach a rolling average below 400 by Sept. 1, which the state accomplished, but officials have said they expected another rise in new cases as the school year began.\n\u201cWe are mindful of COVID-19 cases appearing in various areas of the state, including in our schools. This is expected with many returning to the classroom. Our health departments are committed to providing the best health guidance so schools can effectively reduce outbreaks,\u201d Herbert tweeted on Thursday.\nUtah now has confirmed 38 school outbreaks resulting in 169 cases and eight hospitalizations, according to state health department data.

Of those 84, 23 lived on campus and the rest rent apartments in neighborhoods near the school.\nCollege president the Rev. Kenneth R. Sicard also ordered all on-campus students to stay on campus and off-campus students to self-quarantine in their apartments, to not hold any gatherings indoors or outdoors, and to stay away from bars, restaurants, clubs, and neighborhood businesses \u2014 or they will be suspended.\nCollege staff, Providence police, and private security will monitor the off-campus apartments 24 hours a day, he said.\nSicard also raised the specter of classes not resuming at all, and the spring semester being canceled, if students do not follow the directives from the college and the state Department of Health.\n\u201cThis is the biggest cluster of cases we have had in colleges and universities in Rhode Island,\u201d Department of Health spokesman Joseph Wendelken said. \u201cWe spent a lot of time in the spring and summer focusing on nursing homes, and this highlights that there are challenges in all congregate living settings.\u201d\nAll Providence College students are being tested, and the Health Department \u201cstrongly encouraged\u201d all college students who live in the area and employees of businesses that interact with the students to be tested.\nThe Elmhurst area where many Providence College students live also houses students from nearby Johnson & Wales and Rhode Island College. A visit to the neighborhood Friday morning showed a plethora of delivery trucks, including from Stop & Shop, Amazon, and FedEx.\nTesting of people without symptoms is done at the Rhode Island Convention Center. Appointments are required. To schedule an appointment, go to portal.ri.gov. Anyone who has symptoms should contact their doctor or a local health facility.\n\u201cWe recognize how serious and difficult these directives are, but this is our last chance to remain together in person for the fall semester,\u201d Sicard wrote in a letter to the Providence College community. \u201cBetween these actions and the serious steps we already have taken \u2014 especially in the past few days \u2014 we have used virtually every tool at our disposal. We are out of options. If we are not successful, we will have no alternative other than to shut down our campus for the remainder of the fall semester. This also will likely affect our ability to reopen for the spring semester.\u201d\nSteven J. Maurano, a spokesman for the college, said officials are trying to figure out how the outbreak began. He said the college has not had large gatherings like those seen at other places, such as Syracuse University. But officials are hearing that there might have been a gathering at an off-campus house of 30 or 40 people over the weekend.\n\u201cWith this virus, that is all it takes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know for sure if that is ground zero.\"\nMaurano said it\u2019s too early to focus on disciplining students. At this point, the emphasis is getting students into quarantine and isolation, he said.\nWhile the majority of students who have tested positive live off campus, he said that 23 of the 84 students who tested positive live in Providence College residence halls. Other students included in the total of 124 tested positive at off-campus test sites, he said.\nMaurano said it\u2019s too soon to say if the college will stick with distance learning beyond Sept. 26. He said other colleges that had outbreaks went to remote instruction for two weeks before allowing students to return to classrooms. He said the college will have a better idea of how to proceed after testing of students is completed next week.\nMaurano said he does not think it was a mistake to bring students back to start the fall semester.\n\u201cThe numbers were pretty good until the middle of this week,\u201d he said. \u201cThe large majority of students were and are complying with all the mandates and guidelines. But this virus is pretty insidious. If you have one gathering where someone is positive \u2014 boom \u2014 all of a sudden you can have 30 or 40 positive cases, and they pass it to their contacts.\u201d\nProvidence City Councilman David A. Salvatore said that when he drove to work Friday morning he saw red and blue Solo cups scattered along Eaton Street \u2014 a telltale sign of off-campus student partying. Also, he said constituents have reported students moving around the area without face masks.\n\u201cThere seems to be a culture of defiance among some students in the Providence College community,\u201d Salvatore said.\nSalvatore, who represents the city\u2019s Elmhurst and Wanskuck neighborhoods, said the outbreak endangers residents who live near the campus.\n\u201cI commend Providence College for the increased level of communication,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they can\u2019t police every student 24/7. At some point, ownership falls on the students who are visiting Rhode Island for their college experience to adhere to the expectations. This has to be taken seriously.\u201d\nProvidence College students have faced previous criticism during the pandemic. In May, Providence City Councilwoman Kat Kerwin said she received multiple calls from people who said they \u201cwitnessed reckless partying on Eaton Street,\u201d near the college. At the time, the state had an order in place limiting social gatherings to no more than five people.\nIn August, college officials suspended 17 students for violating the school\u2019s coronavirus code of conduct.\nBrian Donohue-Lynch, who lives near the campus in the Elmhurst neighborhood, said the students and residents of the surrounding area go to the same places \u2014 such as the LaSalle Bakery, Shaw\u2019s supermarket, and Dunkin' Donuts \u2014 and they rely on the same pizza delivery and supermarket delivery services.\nSo it\u2019s not as if the students are living in some kind of bubble that would protect neighbors, he said.\n\u201cThese are students who are integrated in their neighborhoods,\u201d Donohue-Lynch said. \u201cSo to see that there is an outbreak among Providence College students means it\u2019s a hotspot in our neighborhood that affects all of us.\u201d\nHolly Taylor Coolman, a professor at the college who lives near campus, said it\u2019s important to take the virus seriously, but she acknowledged that she does want students to learn on campus.\n\u201cMost of us are still hopeful that there is a chance we can stay on campus and learn together as a community,\u201d Coolman said. \u201cThat said, it is not easy to adopt new protocols that feel awkward. And we have to take the virus seriously. We may have to accept that this just won\u2019t work.\u201d\nDan McGowan can be reached at dan.mcgowan@globe.com. Follow him on Twitter at @danmcgowan.
