Those campuses have also implemented aggressive testing programs, which may help at least in part to explain their low case numbers.\nWhile many colleges and universities are only testing random samples of their student bodies or those with COVID-19 symptoms, Yale and Wesleyan have both committed to testing all students and staff every week. Officials say that allows them to catch cases early, before the virus has a chance to spread through the campus and town populations.\nFrom September 9 to 15, Yale tested 4,931 students and 1,119 faculty and staff, discovering only three cases. The school has recorded 16 total cases since the start of August, according to its official dashboard.\nWesleyan has found similar success, testing 3,493 students and employees and finding only six total cases.\nUConn has been testing less aggressively than Wesleyan and Yale, but still more than other state schools.\nBut even some schools with limited COVID-19 testing have so far avoided cases. In addition to Yale, New Haven\u2019s other colleges \u2014 Southern Connecticut State and Albertus Magnus \u2014 have similarly kept their numbers low, despite less ambitious testing programs.\n\u201cWe have a task force ready to respond but so far we have received zero complaints,\u201d New Haven Health Director Maritza Bond said.\n\u201cThere are inconsistencies across the state as to what each college is doing as far as testing and who is getting tested,\u201d Bond said.\nOther colleges that have largely avoided significant outbreaks include:\nTrinity College, which has recorded 17 cases since mid-August, though 15 in the past two weeks.\nThe University of Hartford, which also has 17 total cases since August, as of Tuesday.\nThe University of New Haven, which has recorded two cases.\nFairfield University, which had seven total cases as of September 10.\nThe University of Bridgeport, which has recorded one case as of Tuesday.\nQuinnipiac University, which has not yet recorded a positive test.\nAlex Putterman can be reached at aputterman@courant.com.
