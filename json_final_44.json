We&rsquo;ve learned that the virus that causes COVID-19 transmits particularly well when a group of people are together in a small, poorly ventilated area. We&rsquo;ve learned that young people are just as susceptible as older people to infection. We&rsquo;ve learned that if there is widespread community transmission, the virus will find its way to the very places we don&rsquo;t want it go.<br>\n So, it&rsquo;s not surprising to us, researchers who study diseases that can be prevented by vaccines, that with schools and colleges reopening, the virus is spreading.<br>\n These are places designed around the idea of bringing lots of people to one place.
