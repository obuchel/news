She said the state agency wouldn't have the authority to suggest the university move to online courses if cases continue to rise, but did say it would recommend guidelines for the campus.</p>\n<p>At James Madison University, where rising infections have put the independent city of Harrisonburg at the top of the nation's outbreaks, the college recorded more than 700 COVID-19 cases in one week of class and promptly pivoted to online instruction on Sept. 1. In the past two weeks, the case rate per 100,000 residents in Harrisonburg has climbed to 1,562. In late July, that number had been at 71 cases per 100,000.</p>\n<p>Even counties where the local college skipped most in-person instruction, like Washington State University in Whitman County, are still susceptible to climbing case counts. That locality had roughly 70 cases per 100,000 residents in two weeks in late July, and now is reporting 1,295 in the last two weeks.</p>\n<p>What&rsquo;s driving that increase, according to Troy Henderson, the county public health director? &ldquo;About 12,000 young adults pulled into a very small rural town.&quot;</p>\n<p>University President Kirk Schulz <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://from.wsu.edu/president/2020/pullman-fall2020-online/email.html\">had asked students in July</a> to remain home to continue their studies.But some students were locked into leases. The university had asked local property owners for some flexibility, but said the landlords &ldquo;advised that they rely on those rent payments to meet their financial obligations.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>When thousands of students showed up anyway, Washington State added new testing centers, created a team to trace virus outbreaks and implored students to follow local health rules, spokesman Phil Weiler said.</p>\n<p>&quot;We don't have the right to tell students where they can and can't live,&quot; Weiler said. &quot;Our students are young adults. We need them to make the right decisions.&quot;</p>\n<p>Henderson said he suspects many students are experiencing fatigue related to the pandemic and returned because they missed the college experience.</p>\n<p>The students and townspeople don&rsquo;t mingle often in Whitman County, he said, but they do go to the same grocery stores and gas stations. Some people have taken to shopping earlier to avoid the younger residents in town.
