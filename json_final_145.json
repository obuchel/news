Gary Herbert&rsquo;s education adviser, said contingency plans were put in place for this reason and are working well throughout the state as COVID-19 cases are identified.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Schools need to be flexible, prepared and nimble,&rdquo; she said, adding that these past few weeks &ldquo;have been filled with excitement ... but also hesitation and worry.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Pyfer, who spoke during the governor&rsquo;s weekly COVID-19 briefing at the state Capitol, pleaded with parents and communities to support their schools and the plans laid out by local districts.

Herbert said both counties have worked with their local health department to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.</p>\n<p><strong>Officials report &lsquo;modest&rsquo; increase in cases on Thursday</strong></p>\n<p>The Utah Department of Health on Thursday reported another 504 new cases of COVID-19 in Utah, bringing the total number of infections that have been detected since mid-March to 53,326.</p>\n<p>The health department estimates that 44,995 people have recovered from their bouts with COVID-19. And, 120 people are currently hospitalized with the disease across the state.</p>\n<p>The rolling seven-day average number of daily cases is 394, which is higher than numbers reported in the last couple weeks. The average percent of positive tests is 9.4%, which is three-tenths of a percentage point higher than Wednesday&rsquo;s average and seven-tenths of a percentage point higher than last Thursday.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not seeing anything specific that is causing this increase,&rdquo; Dr. Angela Dunn, state epidemiologist said. She called Thursday&rsquo;s increase &ldquo;modest&rdquo; and encouraged the public &ldquo;to remain vigilant with prevention measures that we know do work.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Dunn also warned Utahns to be prepared for the impending influenza season by getting the flu vaccine.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Now is not too early to get that,&rdquo; she said. COVID-19, Dunn added, has been more deadly than the flu and has more long-term effects, some of which are still unknown.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take every possible measure to protect ourselves and our community this fall so our schools and businesses can stay open,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>Contrary to news released earlier this week from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Utah&rsquo;s testing capacity has remained robust enough to continue testing asymptomatic people in the state. In fact, Herbert said anyone can and should be tested for COVID-19 if they have even one symptom or otherwise feel the need to be tested.</p>\n<p>He said the federal government will soon be sending rapid antigen testing materials to the state, which offers not only a more convenient way to test for COVID-19, but will help provide results much more quickly, even within 15 minutes.</p>\n<p>Rapid tests will first go to prioritized groups, including first responders, schools, day care and long-term care facilities, as well as other groups dealing with critical infrastructure.</p>\n<p><strong>COVID-19 kills four more in Utah</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to the new cases, four more COVID-19 related deaths were reported by the health department, including three Salt Lake County men, two of whom were between ages 45 and 64, and one who was older than 85 years of age. All three were hospitalized at the time of their deaths. Also included in Thursday&rsquo;s death count was a Utah County man between the ages of 65 and 84, who was also hospitalized at the time of his death.</p>\n<p>The state&rsquo;s death toll from the disease stands at 414.</p>\n<p>The state has tested 668,425 people so far, with results from 5,234 people added since Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Herbert said Utah is faring well, given the circumstances. He said the state&rsquo;s unemployment rate is the best in the nation and that Utah&rsquo;s economy is rebounding better than most states.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This really has been a unique time in our history. Not really in anybody&rsquo;s lifetime have we seen anything like this, that permeates every part of our society,&rdquo; Herbert said. &ldquo;We still have room to improve and longer row to hoe before we&rsquo;re out of this challenge.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The governor asked that Utahns continue to be mindful of the situation going into the Labor Day weekend, which he said for many is &ldquo;the last opportunity to have fun in the sun and socialize with others.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Be careful, not foolish,&rdquo; Herbert said. &ldquo;Together, we can get on top of this.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>New COVID-19 cases reported Thursday by health district across Utah:</strong></p>\n<ul> <li>Salt Lake County, 166</li> <li>Utah County, 169</li> <li>Davis County, 37</li> <li>Southwest Utah, 26</li> <li>Weber-Morgan, 43</li> <li>Bear River (Box Elder, Cache, Rich), 54</li> <li>Summit County, 2</li> <li>San Juan County, -2</li> <li>Tooele County, 6</li> <li>Wasatch County, 2</li> <li>Central Utah, 10</li> <li>TriCounty (Uinta Basin), 3</li> <li>Southeast Utah, 8</li> </ul>\n<p><strong>Contributing:</strong> Marjorie Cortez</p>\n<ul><li data-json=\"{\" data-provider=\"gemini\" data-viewability=\"{\"><figure><a data-cb=\"{\" data-m=\"{\" href=\"https://beap.gemini.yahoo.com/mbclk?bv=1.0.0&es=N7yFaBUGIS9wnS.25ZrLXUUwuNm1TBV70tDibInQHyJ8CybaJXy0Iuq2_gWYl2Eob6TcE6W9NIqK8_OCG4f_O73b8FcH_3TwZ8is1ERoDBu1BslOO6xIlvPNGZriAPoM8YLBhHr6tGb2XS3A1bKmiZyvPD_JegqUBrb3HSQVt6kRMnd00biJIqJe8198iea6Z_k8JZlnYuNg7Wz.ZhbO1A8ca.vsol4H.cB25OPZRMUNl8tjsnxjyQ7UnvdgEzwZjJHkTIdfmlcVMeMfn1OldoIEZr7T4IG8noWahwxGsM9EQ0XJ9Yk7GebMPO6AxUYIFbUSHHrpNSF0RNhYI9vjW0hqF.tdIFgMamktgtHOWRJYBnmDQK6fkDFMieRGNTkehJbF22DmYhb8T8g2V28_0Ym3VFghOn3k105l0Zv3iXIfpFYVfDqsl.0PD9EyFIq06V7xM5PQL16LrUaIhmmhU_IkXZOEvsqy_5a9rW9sxU39rqQpxy2XRTKMkWf.lK0Dkjsz34etc3fjfMBPysKTA6wRQWgwnxsS3N0oLWQP7Aa6ff3_8L7JhJZu4ZL0P6.ZtF3rti6mvk2GmjqgxT2iryBsft0RQPBCrZAbVqirlv1Ptz7CESIyvRX8MJO5fIxOXtHKPL.zcLsULTmAS32w4NWFLCWOGhzhPoBmK671HCu5_Ob_2i3eYSC1jrAiCkbQTBtP9Ai7eAZhjl5yYNBJLZuIZ0j4.aiQG4nVxCJacZ88jwnXMh8wBLWYDqg1CDMGoA6PhMngpEwUq2m7E2QC.iBUBD_ik320x6eQaQsGX_BILLd0dPpe5v1gpS94do6BAdpqPlkOXueGiYCsZ6BljYG_MA_gUEUZQZ.PY8yFUsMk7lOqOzsGYRE1.s0AL08S1.s4GCgfGr6y1LRxDhxcGUsbcxzT2jr5pKBteRxzL3fODCCJOTGOtI5zs6i8zr9ZlCrMQEm7tMn0Rzs-\"><img alt=\"2.4% FIXED Washington Mortgage, No Hidden Fees/Points\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/rNJfBtcR9_6b53XDNSOAeA--~A/Zmk9ZmlsbDt3PTM1NDtoPTE4MTthcHBpZD1nZW1pbmk7cT0xMDA-/https://s.yimg.com/av/curveball/ads/pr/RESIZE_AND_CROP/1200x627/ec45ee5233f03b6502a1c23b5d7f8f27.jpeg\"></img></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://beap.gemini.yahoo.com/mbclk?bv=1.0.0&es=N7yFaBUGIS9wnS.25ZrLXUUwuNm1TBV70tDibInQHyJ8CybaJXy0Iuq2_gWYl2Eob6TcE6W9NIqK8_OCG4f_O73b8FcH_3TwZ8is1ERoDBu1BslOO6xIlvPNGZriAPoM8YLBhHr6tGb2XS3A1bKmiZyvPD_JegqUBrb3HSQVt6kRMnd00biJIqJe8198iea6Z_k8JZlnYuNg7Wz.ZhbO1A8ca.vsol4H.cB25OPZRMUNl8tjsnxjyQ7UnvdgEzwZjJHkTIdfmlcVMeMfn1OldoIEZr7T4IG8noWahwxGsM9EQ0XJ9Yk7GebMPO6AxUYIFbUSHHrpNSF0RNhYI9vjW0hqF.tdIFgMamktgtHOWRJYBnmDQK6fkDFMieRGNTkehJbF22DmYhb8T8g2V28_0Ym3VFghOn3k105l0Zv3iXIfpFYVfDqsl.0PD9EyFIq06V7xM5PQL16LrUaIhmmhU_IkXZOEvsqy_5a9rW9sxU39rqQpxy2XRTKMkWf.lK0Dkjsz34etc3fjfMBPysKTA6wRQWgwnxsS3N0oLWQP7Aa6ff3_8L7JhJZu4ZL0P6.ZtF3rti6mvk2GmjqgxT2iryBsft0RQPBCrZAbVqirlv1Ptz7CESIyvRX8MJO5fIxOXtHKPL.zcLsULTmAS32w4NWFLCWOGhzhPoBmK671HCu5_Ob_2i3eYSC1jrAiCkbQTBtP9Ai7eAZhjl5yYNBJLZuIZ0j4.aiQG4nVxCJacZ88jwnXMh8wBLWYDqg1CDMGoA6PhMngpEwUq2m7E2QC.iBUBD_ik320x6eQaQsGX_BILLd0dPpe5v1gpS94do6BAdpqPlkOXueGiYCsZ6BljYG_MA_gUEUZQZ.PY8yFUsMk7lOqOzsGYRE1.s0AL08S1.s4GCgfGr6y1LRxDhxcGUsbcxzT2jr5pKBteRxzL3fODCCJOTGOtI5zs6i8zr9ZlCrMQEm7tMn0Rzs-\">2.4% FIXED Washington Mortgage, No Hidden Fees/Points</a></figcaption></figure></li><li data-json=\"{\" data-provider=\"gemini\" data-viewability=\"{\"><figure><a data-cb=\"{\" data-m=\"{\" href=\"https://beap.gemini.yahoo.com/mbclk?bv=1.0.0&es=2hknJJYGIS8UdFbtTglR0.B7rBi6thch517A55y.Xcr4F14GxOC0o17ZwXGFBZKV10mBHTrV0rpseshJPAqR2r3tDsL8L5P80gPJxSLLYTXl2FSgUpXPWOGTDcQ.WPJNX2HOCwZrDuOWjPbToYVxoVz5JTWRQdkJglkcM44hux2LZD83TD6yGe9CvWFKyDSDqjn8HQALRVhTZ8MUNFtjAjyo9YwUTmZCo_CO0Y5YZ1_QIRRADUfhdHC04mXumW3u_cdyIVDRFEy7emO3wJh2cgYBtRtXtCPkmZ4SQBo1wF_0F_wMHclPe0nw4IYaWjW2G_rQfCNHhMi.y3pwNpaVytnvInoUgFu4HIybGQxI9BNXNxr7l0.jbM2XR4GtxCQ4ZZR8BuqhpcVHHTorlTcfHQyNetWVhyQVus7GBGAgttIm6UcCBeXl0LU37buqfwwkIBzMsyH4W2R5myVdqU_B.IDLLqk5aPXcX.nnKrGLTU4BfdOSj_ANF_Ph8ivvuvUqkI1j6ccGUoRu3ZV8Z1dxLw8QdZYlLeYWUWHxkHC8RO9dzelOTti_wRyhESvTe6_TBsZ7wIdXLjOUP0ccAimXhsszaC6qhdWkCdjN_s2w8wgsRAwJk3jS9t5YfuO5ro1UZTCxxZkFf0AMtdU6bxrpGC1xZ2T5MF53kI27HwkhuKhs.5e18oDh7x90vmJbYhO_YH7w6EGI3xI4tIh1m6MWB0A-\"><img alt=\"No Pet Insurance?

In fact, Herbert said anyone can and should be tested for COVID-19 if they have even one symptom or otherwise feel the need to be tested.\nHe said the federal government will soon be sending rapid antigen testing materials to the state, which offers not only a more convenient way to test for COVID-19, but will help provide results much more quickly, even within 15 minutes.\nRapid tests will first go to prioritized groups, including first responders, schools, day care and long-term care facilities, as well as other groups dealing with critical infrastructure.\nCOVID-19 kills four more in Utah\nIn addition to the new cases, four more COVID-19 related deaths were reported by the health department, including three Salt Lake County men, two of whom were between ages 45 and 64, and one who was older than 85 years of age. All three were hospitalized at the time of their deaths. Also included in Thursday\u2019s death count was a Utah County man between the ages of 65 and 84, who was also hospitalized at the time of his death.\nThe state\u2019s death toll from the disease stands at 414.\nThe state has tested 668,425 people so far, with results from 5,234 people added since Wednesday.\nHerbert said Utah is faring well, given the circumstances. He said the state\u2019s unemployment rate is the best in the nation and that Utah\u2019s economy is rebounding better than most states.\n\u201cThis really has been a unique time in our history. Not really in anybody\u2019s lifetime have we seen anything like this, that permeates every part of our society,\u201d Herbert said. \u201cWe still have room to improve and longer row to hoe before we\u2019re out of this challenge.\u201d\nThe governor asked that Utahns continue to be mindful of the situation going into the Labor Day weekend, which he said for many is \u201cthe last opportunity to have fun in the sun and socialize with others.\u201d\n\u201cBe careful, not foolish,\u201d Herbert said. \u201cTogether, we can get on top of this.\u201d\nNew COVID-19 cases reported Thursday by health district across Utah:\nSalt Lake County, 166\nUtah County, 169\nDavis County, 37\nSouthwest Utah, 26\nWeber-Morgan, 43\nBear River (Box Elder, Cache, Rich), 54\nSummit County, 2\nSan Juan County, -2\nTooele County, 6\nWasatch County, 2\nCentral Utah, 10\nTriCounty (Uinta Basin), 3\nSoutheast Utah, 8\nContributing: Marjorie Cortez"}]}
