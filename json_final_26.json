The school had 51,000 students in the fall of 2019.</p>\n<p>Since July 6, <a href=\"https://go.illinois.edu/COVIDTestingData\">the school has processed</a> 121,333 COVID tests and in the five days leading up to Friday, which marked the end of the first week of classes, the school administered 47,075 tests and had a 0.75% positivity rate. For context, there were roughly 730,000 COVID tests administered in the entire U.S. on a recent August day, <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/individual-states\">according to</a> Johns Hopkins University&rsquo;s Coronavirus Resource Center. On Aug. 24, U of I administered more than 17,000 tests alone.</p>\n<p>So far, the number of positive cases is in line with what the school&rsquo;s modelers predicted &mdash; well under 400 cases in the week before classes began.
