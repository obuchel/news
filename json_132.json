With the fall sports season beginning, those restrictions are creating friction.\nIn the Kansas City area, the Blue Springs School District asked a judge to overturn Jackson County\u2019s order that prohibits more than 100 spectators at sporting events. The district ignored the order when it allowed more than 400 people to watch the high school football team\u2019s season opener on Aug. 28 against Liberty High School, the Kansas City Star reported.\nThe district said in a court filing that it issued four tickets to each home player, cheerleader and dance team member, and two to each member of those groups from the visiting school. The district said the crowd of 430 was still far below the football stadium\u2019s capacity of about 5,000.\nThe county health department has threatened punishments that could include a ban on spectators, ordered quarantines for athletes and the revocation of concession stand licenses for the remainder of the season.\nCounty Executive Frank White noted that the World Health Organization has recommended limiting the size of gatherings in areas as part of the effort to stop the spread of the virus.\n\u201cYet, despite the apparent universal agreement that large public gatherings pose a substantial risk to the health and safety of our community, the Blue Springs School District has decided to sue the County in the hopes a court will allow them to have more spectators at their football games,\u201d White said.\nAfter new guidelines on youth sports were announced Wednesday for St. Louis County, protesters marched to the home of County Executive Sam Page to vent because they felt the guidelines were still too restrictive.\nThe new guidelines removed some restrictions that had been in place since August and now allow sports with little or no direct contact to be played, including cross-country, tennis, golf and swimming.
