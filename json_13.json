The letter was addressed only to the sixth- and eighth-floor residents of the South Quadrangle dormitory and reported that as of September 17, there had been 19 confirmed positive COVID-19 cases in South Quad.</p>\n<p>The memo went on to note that the majority of the cases were found to be &ldquo;connected,&rdquo; meaning that their origin was known and the outbreak presumably isolated, but that three cases on the sixth floor had not yet been &ldquo;associated&rdquo; and &ldquo;have no known source of exposure.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The memo declared that students should &ldquo;only leave when necessary to obtain food or to attend in-person classes if no remote option is available while wearing a face covering.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The memo also stated that &ldquo;due to increased testing for athletes, they can also leave to attend their athletic events.&rdquo; The university has taken every measure necessary to ensure that resumption of sports. In fact, last week as the university was preparing the shutdown of the GEO strike, it announced that the campus was bringing back the football program, which generated $122 million in profits in 2019.</p>\n<p>The <em>Michigan Daily</em> also reported that Susan Ringler-Cerniglia, public information officer for the Washtenaw County Health Department, refused to say if this was the first cluster on campus.

The building is a short walk from the Harold T. and Vivian Shapiro undergraduate library, as well as the &ldquo;Diag,&rdquo; the main plaza that extends foot traffic to all areas of the campus and the surrounding town. It occupies a ground area of roughly 40,000 square feet and spans vertically approximately 10 floors.</p>\n<p>According to the university housing department&rsquo;s website, the dormitory building is home to an estimated 1,170 students and also includes a dining center, caf&eacute;, and laundry room, multiple group study rooms, music practice studios, and several recreational facilities.</p>\n<p>The report by the <em>Michigan</em> <em>Daily</em> notes that statistics given by the university&rsquo;s online system, the &ldquo;Maize &amp; BluePrint&rdquo; dashboard, contradict the EHS briefing, lagging behind in its official reporting of the known number of confirmed positive cases. While the EHS memo tallies the current positive case count in South Quad at 19, the system only reported 13 as of Monday.</p>\n<p>An undergraduate student spoke anonymously to the WSWS about another recent series of positive cases occurring in Stockwell Hall, which lies just a mile to the northeast of South Quad: &ldquo;Our first case was a while ago and we got an email from EHS. Then another [student] who tested positive was in my hall and&hellip;texted the hall group &lsquo;chat&rsquo; right away. The next day we got an email from EHS that there were two new cases in Stockwell&hellip;and one was an unrelated case from another floor.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The student continued, &ldquo;I think the administration should start testing the entire student body that is living in Ann Arbor twice a week, like what they&rsquo;re doing at UIUC [the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign]. That way, we have a better chance of allowing students to stay on campus while also catching as many cases as possible.
