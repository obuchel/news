(WXYZ) — The Ingham County Health Department is taking emergency action after a severe outbreak of COVID-19 linked to students at Michigan State University.The county issued an order mandating a 14-day quarantine for certain addresses where there is congregate housing, including 23 sorority and fraternity houses, and 7 large rental properties in East Lansing.RELATED: Mandatory quarantine issued for 30 East Lansing houses linked to COVID-19 outbreakAccording to health officials, people living in the homes have known cases or have been exposed to COVID -19, and are calling the outbreak a “crisis.”As Spartan students returned to East Lansing last month, the coronavirus came with them.COVID-19 cases for Michigan State University Students and those affiliated with the school jumped 52% -- from just 3 the week of August 24th to between 400 and 500 cases as of Monday.“We have the highest numbers in the state right now. We are looking at a county that has 190-some cases per day, per million, which is the highest in the entire state and that’s alarming,” said Ingham County Health Officer Linda Veil.MSU Professor Sarah Reckhow started an online petition, urging the school to mandate testing for the coronavirus and demanding daily case information. Right now, the university only reports COVID-19 cases once a week.“If you look at the University of Michigan, if you look at Ohio State University, they’re reporting daily COVID numbers, and they’re reporting the number of tests. We don’t even know the positivity rate among MSU students,” said Reckhow.Reckhow says even though all MSU undergrad classes are online, students still returned to off-campus housing, and they’re getting sick. She worries about the exposure for the entire East Lansing community.“They are enrolled at Michigan State University, and the university still has the resources to be testing and tracking COVID-19 much more systematically than they are,” said Reckhow. “It does not look like our leadership is responding as urgently as is required, given that we are in a public health crisis right now.”MSU does have daily saliva tests, known as the Spartan Spit Kit, that can test students quickly and painlessly. But they’re strictly voluntary.MSU spokesperson Dan Olsen told the 7 Investigators that they school cannot mandate the saliva tests, since they are not allowed by the FDA for that kind of us. Olsen said they do encourage all students to enroll in the voluntary study that allows for daily saliva testing. Olsen also said MSU has not mandated other forms of testing, preferring instead to keep that available for students who are symptomatic and most need it.Ingham County health officials say at least a third of the new cases are students who recently attended parties, and at least a third of those gatherings are associated with a fraternity or sorority.Now the health department is asking students to only leave their homes or rooms to get food, essential supplies, or medical care.“We are looking at numbers that make April and May pale in comparison, it’s like nothing even happened when you look at the graph,” said Veil. “We have got to stop the types of activities that are continuing to cause the transmission of this virus, and we know that social gatherings are the primary source for all of that.”“We share in the concern of our public health experts and will hold students accountable for complying with all local health orders as outlined in our community compact — even if they are off campus. We all share in the responsibility of protecting ourselves and each other. This mandatory quarantine for specific off-campus houses is another helpful tool to stop the spread of COVID-19,” said MSU Spokesperson Emily Gerkin Guerrant.MSU is working on launching a daily case dashboard, but it’s not clear when it will be available.If you have a story for Heather Catallo, email her at hcatallo@wxyz.comThe Ingham County Health Department is taking emergency action after a severe outbreak of COVID-19 linked to students at Michigan State University.The county issued an order mandating a 14-day quarantine for certain addresses where there is congregate housing, including 23 sorority and fraternity houses, and 7 large rental properties in East Lansing.According to health officials, people living in the homes have known cases or have been exposed to COVID -19, and are calling the outbreak a “crisis.”As Spartan students returned to East Lansing last month, the coronavirus came with them.COVID-19 cases for Michigan State University Students and those affiliated with the school jumped 52% -- from just 3 the week of August 24th to between 400 and 500 cases as of Monday.“We have the highest numbers in the state right now.

""We are here to support you through it.""The university offered students in residences, whether they were isolating or not, a four-week rent rebate in recognition of the difficult circumstances, plus money towards food, and clothes washing services for students who cannot leave their room.In Manchester, students at residential halls at Manchester Metropolitan University have to self-isolate for 14 days after 127 tested positive for COVID-19.Jo Grady, head of the University and College Union, said the outbreaks were wholly predictable and said all teaching should go online. ""There is no point encouraging students to come to university to self-isolate for a fortnight,"" she said.Britain's top universities routinely feature on the list of the best colleges in the world and international pupils travel from across the world to attend.(Reporting by Kate Holton; editing by Jason Neely)",https://news.yahoo.com/uk-universities-grapple-spiralling-covid-145235690.html,

10,"By Anurag Maan, Roshan Abraham3 Min Read(Reuters) - The number of novel coronavirus cases in the United States topped 7 million - more than 20% of the world’s total - as Midwest states reported spikes in COVID-19 infections in September, according to a Reuters tally.The latest milestone on Thursday comes just days after the nation surpassed over 200,000 COVID-19 deaths, the world’s highest death toll from the virus. Each day, over 700 people die in the United States from COVID-19.California leads the country with over 800,000 total cases, followed by Texas, Florida and New York. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/363tab5)All Midwest states except Ohio reported more cases in the past four weeks as compared with the prior four weeks, led by South Dakota and North Dakota. South Dakota had the biggest percentage increase at 166% with 8,129 new cases, while North Dakota’s new cases doubled to 8,752 as compared to 4,243 during the same time in August.Many cases in those two states have been linked to the annual motorcycle rally in Sturgis, South Dakota, that annually attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors.According to a Reuters analysis, positive cases rose in half of the 50 U.S. states this month. Ten states have reported a record one-day increase in COVID-19 cases in September, including Montana, South Dakota and Utah on Thursday.New cases rose last week after falling for eight consecutive weeks. Health experts believe this spike was due to reopening schools and universities as well as parties over the recent Labor Day holiday.Slideshow ( 5 images )A study by researchers from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Indiana University, the University of Washington and Davidson College said recent reopening of college and university campuses for in-person instruction during late summer this year could be associated with more than 3,000 additional cases of COVID-19 per day in the United States in recent weeks.U.S. confirmed cases are the highest in the world followed by India with 5.7 million cases and Brazil with 4.6 million.The United states is currently averaging 40,000 new infections per day. Top U.S. infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci has said he would like to see the number to fall below 10,000 per day before flu season starts in October.Health officials and President Donald Trump have presented different views about the nation’s health crisis. Trump, who is seeking re-election to a second term on Nov. 3, early this month had claimed that the United States was “rounding the corner” on the crisis. Fauci contradicted the claim the next day, saying the statistics were disturbing.Reporting by Anurag Maan and Roshan Abraham in Bengaluru; Editing by Lisa ShumakerOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-cases-idUSKCN26G053,

12,"Editor's note: Find the latest COVID-19 news and guidance in Medscape's   Coronavirus Resource Center.  
Approximately 20% of asymptomatic people who test positive for COVID-19 will remain symptom-free over time, according to two studies published September 22 in different journals. The researchers propose, therefore, that most asymptomatic patients should be considered presymptomatic.


""Only a minority of people with SARS-CoV-2 have a truly asymptomatic infection. Most patients with SARS-CoV-2 who are asymptomatic at the time of testing will go on to develop symptoms,"" study author Nicola Low, MD, head of the Research Group at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine at the University of Bern in Switzerland, told Medscape Medical News. 
The result also suggests expanded testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection is warranted, especially among those at higher risk, and supports use of control measures including masks, physical distancing, and isolation. 




""People with asymptomatic infection are infectious. All should be isolated and contact tracing should be started,"" Low added.


Low and colleagues performed a living systemic review and meta-analysis evaluating the occurrence and transmission of asymptomatic and presymptomatic patients. They published their findings in PLOS Medicine.
Sung-Han Kim, MD, PhD, and co-investigators conducted a study comparing levels of SARS-CoV-2 in the nose and throat of asymptomatic vs symptomatic individuals published in the journal Thorax.  
The research teams out of Switzerland and South Korea point to a need for more clarity on which patients with COVID-19 are asymptomatic vs presymptomatic. Most previous researchers tested people for SARS-CoV-2 infection at a single time, preventing identification of the percentage who subsequently developed symptoms.






The previous work also has been heterogeneous. ""Researchers have investigated the proportion with asymptomatic infection in a wide range of settings, including hospitals, as part of outbreaks, through contact tracing, and through screening,"" Low said. The variability between estimates was ""very high,"" from 3% to 83% in individual studies, she added.
 Main Meta-Analysis Findings 
Low and colleagues searched PubMed, Embase, bioRxiv and MedRxiv for relevant studies. The ""living"" meta-analysis reflects ongoing updates in March, April, and June of this year. They used reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2.
The data included a statistical modeling study of all 634 passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship with RT-PCR positive test results.




Overall, in 79 studies conducted in a range of different settings, 20% of people with SARS-CoV-2 infection remained asymptomatic during follow-up.

When confined to seven studies that screened defined populations with follow-up, a higher proportion (31%) remained asymptomatic over time.

The researchers caution their asymptomatic estimate was limited by biases in study designs. Furthermore, they found it difficult to identify the proportion of asymptomatic and presymptomatic patients who contribute to the overall transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

A subset of five studies include detailed contact tracing. From this data, the investigators calculated the risk of asymptomatic people transmitting SARS-CoV-2 was lower (summary risk ratio, 0.35, compared with symptomatic people at 0.63). More trials are needed to confirm these findings, they note.

""The findings from systematic reviews, including ours, do not support the claim that a large majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections are asymptomatic,"" they add. Furthermore, because SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted a few days before an infected person develops symptoms, ""presymptomatic transmission likely contributes substantially to overall SARS-CoV-2 epidemics.""

 Similar Viral Loads Found in South Korea 
Kim and colleagues found almost the same proportion, 19% of 213 patients, without severe symptoms of COVID-19 remained asymptomatic through potential exposure, lab confirmation, and hospital admission.

The upper respiratory tract viral load did not differ significantly between asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals in upper respiratory tract samples in South Korea.

""Our data adds to the recent growing body of evidence that asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection are indeed contributing to the ongoing community spread of COVID-19, senior study author Kim told Medscape Medical News.

The mean cycle threshold (Ct) values of SARS-CoV-2 genes, which reflect the viral load, ""were highly similar between asymptomatic individuals and symptomatic patients,"" added Kim, professor of infectious diseases and chief of the Office of Infection Control at Asan Medical Center in Seoul, South Korea.

The findings suggest that asymptomatic individuals have ""a comparable potential for spreading the virus as much as symptomatic patients,"" he said. ""To prevent the transmission from asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the use of face masks by the general public — regardless of the presence of symptoms — is highly recommended.""

The study was feasible because of a unique situation — a COVID-19 outbreak in Daegu City was traced to a single religious group. The 3000 close contacts identified reported symptoms from none to severe, and the asymptomatic people were isolated and monitored in dedicated facilities.

""We were able to assess many asymptomatic individuals who were otherwise unlikely to be identified as cases of COVID-19,"" the investigators note.

A subset of 183 patients, including 39 asymptomatic people and 144 who were symptomatic, underwent follow-up RT-PCR testing. Swab samples from the nasopharynx and oropharynx were combined in a single assay.

As most asymptomatic people with COVID-19 continue to live in a community setting, the researchers note, ""such individuals may act as an essential driving force for the community spread of COVID-19 and the ongoing pandemic state.""

A limitation of the study was a population largely composed of individuals in their 20s and 30s, so the generalizability to other age groups is unknown.

 Uncertainty Remains 
""These studies represent valuable contributions, but also underline how much uncertainty remains. Neither says much about asymptomatic transmission,"" Jonathan Dushoff, PhD, professor, Department of Biology, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada, told Medscape Medical News when asked to comment on the research.

""They don't seem to me to change the consensus that people without symptoms, whether asymptomatic or presymptomatic, should be seen as potential spreaders, even though there is weak evidence that they are less  contagious than people with symptoms,"" added Dushoff, who coauthored a study on the timing of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 transmission published in June in the journal Epidemics.

 Not an Easy Task 
""It would be actually difficult and challenging to provide a real estimate of the asymptomatic transmission rates,"" Lei Huang, MD, told Medscape Medical News when asked to comment. People without symptoms may be unaware that they were exposed to someone else during the virus incubation period, Huang added.

Studying a randomly selected population, one that is representative and generalizable to settings where disease transmission is known to occur, would be a more ideal approach, Huang said.

The current research ""suggests that in places where transmission has occurred, it would always be helpful to pay special attention to self-protection, even when facing someone who appears to be perfectly healthy,"" said Huang, lead author of a prospective, contact-tracing study that revealed rapid transmission of COVID-19 in asymptomatic people aged 16 to 23 years.

""While the chance of transmission from asymptomatic cases may be lower than from symptomatic ones, the importance of asymptomatic transmission should never be ignored considering the uncertainty of the real proportion of asymptomatic cases,"" said Huang, who is affiliated with the Department of General Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Anhui Province, China.

 Low is a member of the PLOS Medicine editorial board.  Kim, Dushoff, and Huang have disclosed no relevant financial relationships. 

 The Swiss National Science Foundation, the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, a Swiss government excellence scholarship, and a stipend from the Swiss School of Public Health Global P3H  funded the PLoS Medicine study. 

 A grant from the Korea Health Technology R&D Project through the Korea Health Industry Development Institute, funded by the Ministry of Health & Welfare, Republic of Korea, supported the study in Thorax.
