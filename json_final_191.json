USPS said in the plan that first shipments of masks were expected to reach U.S. households at an unspecified date in April.\nThe document demonstrates how the Postal Service\u2019s role in the pandemic response may have been more involved than initially reported this spring.\nNearly half of US public say they wouldn\u2019t get a COVID-19 vaccine: Pew study\nEven after government agencies and pharmaceutical companies pledged their independence in the race to find a vaccine for the coronavirus, Americans are still divided over whether they would get vaccinated.\nAccording to a Pew Research Center survey, nearly half of U.S. adults (49%) say they definitely or probably would not get vaccinated at this time. Intent to get a COVID-19 vaccine has fallen by 21% since May.\nWhile intent to get a vaccinated has declined across all major political and demographic groups, some differences remain. Just 32% of Black adults say they would definitely get a vaccine compared with 52% of white adults, 56% of Hispanics and 72% of Asian Americans.\nThe national survey was conducted Sept. 8-13 among more than 10,000 U.S. adults.\nVideo: New school year | Look up vaccine exemption rates (KENS-TV San Antonio)\nLas Vegas bars, taprooms, breweries will be allowed to reopen on Sunday\nAfter a six-month shutdown due to COVID-19, Nevada officials announced bars, taprooms and breweries can reopen Sunday night in Clark County, where Las Vegas is located. Nevada's COVID-19 Mitigation and Management Task Force on Thursday unanimously approved the county's plan to reopen drinking businesses throughout the Las Vegas Valley.\nClark County Commission Chairwoman Marilyn Kirkpatrick told the task force that bar owners are committed to following health and safety protocols. State biostatistician Kyra Morgan revealed the COVID-19 positivity rate dropped from 8.6% to 7.8% between Monday and Thursday. The World Health Organization's recommends that rate should be no higher than 5%.\n\u2013 Ed Komenda, Reno Gazette Journal\nUtah governor considers statewide mask mandate amid COVID-19 surge\nUtah Gov. Gary Herbert said Thursday he is considering a statewide mask mandate and planning expanded coronavirus testing in response to what he called an alarming spike of infections in the state.\nThe state counted 911 new confirmed cases on Thursday, a new record for any single day. The rolling average of daily new cases has increased by about 54% over the past two weeks, according to state data, and has jumped to 661 per day this week compared to 381 per day last week.\n\u201cWe are taking this spike and the magnitude of it very seriously,\u201d Herbert told reporters.\nHerbert, a Republican, has urged residents to wear masks for months but has stopped short of implementing a statewide mandate. He has instead allowed counties to decide if they needed bans.\n\u2013 Kaitlyn Bancroft, The Spectrum & Daily News (St. George, Utah)\nIndia's coronavirus case count increases by 96K over 24 hours\nIndia\u2019s coronavirus cases jumped by another 96,424 infections in the past 24 hours, showing little sign of leveling.\nThe Health Ministry on Friday raised the nation\u2019s total past 5.21 million, or about 0.37% of its nearly 1.4 billion people. It said 1,174 more people died in the past 24 hours, for a total of 84,372 fatalities, but experts say India's death toll may be a significant undercount.\nIndia\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his birthday on Thursday made a fresh appeal to people to wear masks and maintain social distance as his government chalked out plans to handle big congregations expected during a major Hindu festival season beginning next month.\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott relaxes limit restrictions on businesses; bars must stay closed\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott said Thursday that he would allow businesses to expand pandemic limits on capacity in most of the state, citing a decline in coronavirus hospitalizations.\nThe order allows businesses operating at 50% capacity to move to 75% starting Monday. That includes restaurants, retail, office buildings, manufacturing, gyms, libraries and museums. Bars remain closed under the order, although some have been able to reopen by selling more food than alcohol.\n\u201cWithout vaccines available, containing COVID is a challenge, but Texans have already shown that they are up to that challenge,\u201d Abbott said at a Capitol news conference. \u201cAs we go about the process to continue to contain COVID, we will also continue to work to open up Texas.\u201d\nAnd Abbott is allowing hospitals in much of the state to resume elective surgeries, effective immediately. Nursing homes and other long-term care facilities may resume visitations next Thursday, as long as there are no outbreaks at those facilities.\n\u2013 Nicole Cobler, Austin-American Statesman\nSurvey: 751 Arizona teachers have resigned or retired since school began\nThere are fewer teachers than ever in Arizona classrooms, according to a new survey from the Arizona School Personnel Administrators Association.\nJust a few weeks into the school year, about 28% of teacher positions in the state remained vacant compared with 21% vacant last year, the data shows, which means about 3 in 10 classrooms are not led by a qualified teacher. Schools have had to fill those open positions with long-term substitute teachers or others without teaching qualifications.\nTeachers across the state have said COVID-19 adds to the pressure to quit, especially when faced with the threat of returning to the classroom amid the pandemic. Some medically vulnerable teachers are particularly worried about contracting the virus while around students. Arizona school districts had about 6,145 open positions this year \u2014 1,728 remain vacant, compared with 1,443 in 2019.\n\u2013 Lily Altavena, Arizona Republic\nModerna says vaccine trial results could come in November\nModerna, one of the companies leading the effort to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, announced Thursday it could have enough clinical trial results as soon as November to confirm the effectiveness of its candidate vaccine.\nResults of the vaccine\u2019s effectiveness will be presented to an independent review committee after 53 people in the trial contract COVID-19, and again after 106 and 151 infections. Half the participants are getting a placebo and half the active vaccine, called mRNA-1273.\nStatistically, if the vaccine is effective 75% of the time, it should take only 106 infections in both groups to prove its effectiveness, Dr. Jacqueline Miller, Moderna\u2019s senior vice president of infectious disease development, told company investors on Thursday. At that point, which will likely come in November, Moderna could apply for an emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to begin distributing the vaccine.\nThe FDA has said a vaccine must be at least 50% effective to win federal approval, but the companies developing vaccines have said they are aiming for at least 60% and hopefully even higher effectiveness. Moderna had originally predicted that it might take until May 2021 to prove its vaccine\u2019s effectiveness, but pushed up that timeline because participants joined quickly, the COVID-19 infection rate remained high around trial sites and the company was able to start the trial earlier than originally expected.\n\u2013 Karen Weintraub\nCOVID-19 resources from USA TODAY\nOn Facebook: A lot is still unknown about the coronavirus.
