No laboratory diagnostic test is 100% perfect, capable of giving a clear-cut &lsquo;Yes/No&rsquo; answer for every person to whom a test is administered. There will be some false negatives and some false positives. In a fast-spreading pandemic like Covid-19, we look for a test which yields very few false negative results. However, the results published and projected by those who develop and market the test are of technical sensitivity. The real world experience is less rewarding, for a variety of reasons that relate to the timing of the test after a person is exposed to the virus, the sampling site and technique.

A specificity of 98% may work well in laboratory conditions or when the test is used in persons with a clinically-judged high probability of infection, but may yield many false positive results in mass testing. Pettengill and McAdam point out that if a test with 98% specificity is used every day for mass testing in each member of the 325 million population of the US, &ldquo;there would be a staggering 6.5 million false positive results each day&rdquo;. They also point out that many people would not agree to frequent testing, even if that improves case identification and reduces the false negative labelling of individuals.
